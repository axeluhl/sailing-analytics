/**
 * File: IgtimiTimeSync
 * Project: timesync
 *
 * Version 0.1.0
 *
 * Author Stephen Markham
 * Date 01/03/2019
 * Copyright 2019, Igtimi Ltd.
 * Description
 *    Protocol definition for using non-standard methods of timesync using Igtimi's services.
 *    The service should *only* be used when UDP is not a viable option as it does not provide the same
 *    level of accuracy.
 *
 * TODO:
 *    Check that this can be compiled without the gRPC libraries. If not, remove the service and place in TimeSync repo
 *
 * Note: Versions < 1.0 are liable to breaking changes (including structure)
 *        and therefore implementations based of these should proceed with caution.
 *        After 1.0 all changes *should* be backwards compatible.
