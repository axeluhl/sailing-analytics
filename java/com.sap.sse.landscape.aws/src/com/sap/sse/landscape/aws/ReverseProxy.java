/**
 * Represents an HTTP/HTTPS reverse proxy that is able to manage redirection rule sets for "level 7" routing, primarily
 * based on hostnames but probably also on {@link Scope}s and their identifiers. If this reverse proxy employs several
 * {@link Host}s to provide its service then those are assumed to share a common configuration. This interface grants
 * access to this common configuration.
 * <p>
 * 
 * Each hostname can be mapped to at most one {@link ApplicationReplicaSet application replica set}, and only one
 * redirect strategy can be selected for such a hostname. The reverse proxy will rewrite such requests, including HTTP
 * to HTTPS forwarding and depending on the strategy selected appending a path to a bare URL with no path components
 * that point to a specific landing page.
 * <p>
 * 
 * Generally, setting a redirect for a hostname will replace an already existing mapping for an equal hostname. Clients
 * using this interface don't have to worry about the details of reloading the configuration or restarting the reverse
 * proxy service; calling the methods through this interface will do what it takes.
 * <p>
 * 
 * We think that such reverse proxies should be used as "cold-storage" handlers, mapping scopes and hostnames of content
 * through "default" load balancer rules. Such default rules should forward all requests to a target group that contains
 * the {@link #getHosts() hosts} forming this reverse proxy. By allowing for multiple hosts that all share the same
 * reverse proxy configuration, scalability as well as availability can be addressed.<p>
 * 
 * In the future, support may be added to maintain a set of {@link TargetGroup target groups} forwarding traffic to this
 * reverse proxy as hosts are added to or removed from this reverse proxy installation.
