/**
 * {@link ReentrantReadWriteLock} can produce a lock between readers and other readers if the lock
 * is <em>fair</em> and a writer applies between the first read lock acquisition and the second read
 * lock acquisition attempt. We try to enhance {@link LockUtil} such that it is possible to pass
 * a "lock set" from one thread to the next, such that when a thread tries to acquire a read lock
 * that is already in the thread's lock set, it doesn't really acquire the lock but only increments
 * a counter. This will then avoid the read-read deadlock.
