/**
 * Represents a maneuver detected within a competitor track. There are two important sections within a maneuver.
 * <ol>
 * <li>The first section starts from sailing a stable speed at TWA and ends at getting back to a stable speed and target
 * TWA. This section is defined as maneuver curve and its time range is represented by {@code timePointBefore} and
 * {@code timePointAfter}. The target speeds and courses are represented by {@code speedWithBearingBefore} and
 * {@code speedWithBearingAfter}.</li>
 * <li>The second section is called main curve and is defined as the section within the maneuver curve, where highest
 * course change has been performed. This means that the main curve is a subset of the maneuver curve which is
 * represented by {@code timePointBeforeMainCurve} and {@code timePointAfterMainCurve}.</li>
 * </ol>
 * The maneuver curve is an expansion of the main curve. The expansion relates the points with stable course and speed
 * before and after main curve. In contrast to maneuver curve, the main curve computation does not take speed into
 * account and is based only on gradual analysis of course changes within the maneuver progress. The main curve is
 * supposed to deliver information about the acceleration during continuous turning in the direction of maneuver which
 * can be used for boat class oriented investigations. On the other side, the maneuver curve describes a section where
 * the boat starts loosing speed and course stability due to maneuvering preparations, followed by maneuver performance,
 * acceleration and realignment to the target course on new tack. Based on the maneuver curve, the maneuver loss is
 * computed which is regarded as an important measurement feature in order to compare performances of competing racers.
 * In contrast to main curve, the maneuver curve reveals strategic decision making of individual sailors to master a
 * maneuver with minimal maneuver loss.
