/**
 * Different tracking providers require different sets of arguments to start tracking a race.
 * This interface represents the functionality required to start tracking a race, agnostic of the
 * particular parameters and ways of launching the connector. Use {@link #createRaceTracker()} to
 * create the tracker that starts tracking the race identified by these tracking parameters.<p>
 * 
 * The parameters also tell whether wind tracking shall be activated for this race (see {@link #isTrackWind()}).
 * This property can be {@link #setTrackWind(boolean) updated}, making sense in case tracking a live race
 * is stopped in a running server, stopping the wind tracker and therefore not requiring wind tracking
 * to be activated anymore when the race is restored during server restart.
