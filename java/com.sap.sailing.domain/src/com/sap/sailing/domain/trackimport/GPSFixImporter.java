/**
 * Importer for extracting GPS fixes from an {@link InputStream}. Importers are picked up via the OSGi service registry,
 * so make sure to register them (the {@link GPSFixImporterRegistration} class can help with this).
 * <p>
 * 
 * Implementers need to {@link #getType() provide a unique type name} for the importer and may
 * {@link #getSupportedFileExtensions() specify the file name extensions} for the file types supported.
 * The actual work is done by the implementation of {@link #importFixes(InputStream, Callback, boolean)} which
 * receives the input stream that the importer shall analyze. When the start of a track is found, the importer must call the
 * {@link Callback#startTrack(String, Map)} method. From that point onwards, all fixes that the importer recognizes in the
 * stream and that it passes to {@link Callback#addFix(GPSFix)} are then assigned to that track which means that
 * for each track an artificial {@link DeviceIdentifier} is created which can later be used to associate the track
 * with a tracked object such as a competitor or a mark. Note that this means that all fixes of a single track need
 * to be passed to the callback before fixes of any other track can be passed to the callback.<p>
 * 
 * If the data source to import from does not deliver course and speed over ground (COG/SOG) but only time-stamped
 * latitude and longitude values, consider using <code>BaseGPSFixImporterImpl</code> which infers COG and SOG values
 * from the positions and time stamps.
