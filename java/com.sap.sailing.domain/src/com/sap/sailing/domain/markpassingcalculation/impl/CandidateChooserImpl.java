     * The value sets contain all candidates found, but not for all of them do we want to
     * construct {@link Edge}s in the {@link #allEdges graph}. Whenever a competitor's candidate set
     * changes, filter rules are applied to eliminate redundant and "stray" candidates. For example,
     * if a tracker has been left on the race committee boat forming one end of the start line, and
     * the tracker keeps tracking, it will swerve back and forth slightly, producing many distance
     * candidates for various waypoints. By identifying that the tracker hasn't left a small bounding
     * box over significant amounts of time, many of those candidates can be removed and represented by,
     * say, the first and the last candidate in that small bounding box.<p>
     * 
     * Furthermore, specifically for {@link DistanceCandidateImpl distance candidates} we often see
     * candidates for different marks created for approximately (sometimes even precisely) the same
     * time point. For example, if a tracker approaches a start line from the leeward side and then
     * moves away again, a candidate for the start line but also for the gate situated on the windward
     * side of the start line will be created, roughly at the same time. Of those fixes only the one or
     * two most likely ones should have edges constructed for them. This should help eliminate, e.g.,
     * candidates for the windward mark if the tracker was near the start line at that time. This augments
     * the filter rule suppressing candidates with very low probability; it takes relative probability
     * of candidates with similar time points into account.<p>
     * 
     * Note, however, that we cannot know for which lap a candidate has to be created. If the same mark
     * is referred to by more than one {@link Waypoint} in the {@link Course}, if one candidate survives
     * the filtering then the respective candidates for all occurrences of that mark have to survive, too.
     * Example: if the fix reaches maximum proximity to the windward mark, candidates for all occurrences
     * of the windward mark in the course's waypoints will result. Around that time, other candidates may
     * have been produced due to the course change also for the leeward gate or even the start line or an
     * offset mark. Comparing the probabilities of the candidates in such a narrow time window will usually
     * show as many equal-rated candidates for the windward mark as there are occurrences of the windward
     * mark in the course. All of them need to pass the filter, and not only a single one. Other candidates
     * from the time window whose probability is discernably less should be filtered.
