/**
 * Various sources report different things about Java thread priorities and how they are mapped to operating system
 * thread priorities. If we want to support differently prioritized thread pools through {@link ThreadPoolUtil}, it
 * would be great if we had a good understanding of this this works and what the effects are.<p>
 * 
 * This test runs threads with the various Java thread priorities and lets them do trivial work, counting progress
 * over a fixed period of time. The different progresses of all threads are then output.
