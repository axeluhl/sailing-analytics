          <ul class="bulletList">
                <li>When WindBots sent buffered data, e.g., from previous days, there was a possibility that
                    under some circumstances this data may have interfered with live data, leading, e.g.,
                    to "jumping" WindBot positions. This has now been fixed.<p>
                <li>For the following system properties, alternative environment variables have been introduced:
                    <ul>
                        <li><tt>AWS_S3_TEST_S3ACCESSID</tt> for <tt>aws.s3.test.s3AccessId</tt></li>
                        <li><tt>AWS_S3_TEST_S3ACCESSKEY</tt> for <tt>aws.s3.test.s3AccessKey</tt></li>
                        <li><tt>GOOGLE_MAPS_AUTHENTICATION_PARAMS</tt> for <tt>google.maps.authenticationparams</tt></li>
                        <li><tt>YOUTUBE_V3_API_KEY</tt> for <tt>youtube.api.key</tt></li>
                        <li><tt>GEONAMES_ORG_USERNAMES</tt> for <tt>geonames.org.usernames</tt></li>
                    </ul>   
                    If the system property is set, it takes precedence over the environment variable.</li>
          </ul>
          <h2 class="articleSubheadline">September 2025</h2>
          <ul class="bulletList">
                <li>Added boat classes "Elan E4" and "Beneteau First 36" to the list of boat classes.<p>
          </ul>
          <h2 class="articleSubheadline">August 2025</h2>
          <ul class="bulletList">
                <li>Pairings, e.g., in league set-ups, can not be copied across regattas/leaderboards.
                    This allows users to create a hidden regatta/leaderboard with flights to the entire
                    season, create a pairing list for that and the copy sub-sequences from it to
                    the regattas of the individual events. This can help improve the fairness of
                    pairing lists across an entire season.</li>
                <li>Upon popular demand, the series editing dialog now supports not only 50 but 100
                    race columns / flights to be created in the drop-down list.</li>
                <li>AI Agent credentials can now be reset from the Admin Console.</li>
                <li>When using the Advanced / Landscape Management page of the Admin Console, and a new
                    application load balancer (ALB) is created (e.g., in response to the number of ALB
                    listener rules exceeding the limit for all existing ALBs in the region), the new ALB
                    will automatically be registered with any AWS Web Application Firewall (WAF) access
                    control list (Web ACL) that has a tag "web-acl-purpose" with value "geoblocking".<p>

          <h2 class="articleSubheadline">June 2025</h2>
          <ul class="bulletList">
                <li>Introduced a new Low Point scoring scheme for overall leaderboards which---instead of using the <em>ranks</em>
                    from the contained leaderboards---uses the net points from those leaderboards. This way, the overall leaderboard's
                    point sum equals the total points sum of the leaderboards (if no discards are configured for the overall leaderboard).
                    Tie breaking is by rule A8.1, as usual. Use this if you want to give emphasis to each act according to the number
                    of races/flights sailed in them.</li>
                <li>ORC Performance Curve Scoring (PCS) was renamed to "ORC Polar Curve Scoring" with the acronym unchanged. We have adjusted
                    our message texts in the UI accordingly. Furthermore, the "CIRCULAR_RANDOM" pre-set is now called "All Purpose,"
                    and "LONG_DISTANCE" is now called "Ocean Race." Non-spinnaker allowances now typically come in separate certificates.</li>
                <li>Upgraded embedded Jetty web server, closing CVE-2024-13009</li>
                <li>Added boat classes "ORC Multihull" and "SRS" (also known as "LYS")</li>
                <li>Added action to remotely trigger a calibration run on a WindBot device.</li>
                <li>New scoring system for iQFOil medal series mode where two, not one, get promoted straight into the grand final.</li>
          </ul>
          <h2 class="articleSubheadline">May 2025</h2>
          <ul class="bulletList">
                <li>The Riot server listening for WindBot data now properly implements connection closing upon not having
                    received device heartbeat messages for more than 30s.</li>
                <li>Users can now file take-down requests for media assets displayed on the web site. This includes
                    event stage/logo/teaser/gallery images and videos, as well as competitor images and competitor flags.
                    For all these assets, a little semi-transparent three-dots button is displayed in the top-left
                    corner of the image/video tile. When a logged-in user with a validated e-mail address clicks the
                    button, a popup dialog allows for additional input and submitting of the take-down request, which
                    will lead to an e-mail being sent to support@sapsailing.com.</li>
                <li>Fixed parsing of X-Forwarded-For header, now reporting the correct client IP in case of multiple proxies along the way.</li>
                <li>Improved logging in case operations received from replicas are being applied. The log entry now shows the name of the server
                    where the operation originated from.</li>
          </ul>
          <h2 class="articleSubheadline">March 2025</h2>
          <ul class="bulletList">
                <li>We included a new AI Agent, based on <a href="https://help.sap.com/docs/sap-ai-core/sap-ai-core-service-guide/what-is-sap-ai-core">SAP AI Core</a>,
                    that helps commenting races, live and replay. To configure the agent,
                    the administration console has a new "AI Agent" tab. It shows whether credentials for the
                    underlying AI Core service have been provided, allows users to provide these,
                    shows which language model is currently selected for producing the comments
                    and displays the list of events, allowing the user to select for which of those
                    the AI Agent shall be activated to produce comments. The comments will be produced
                    when certain events in those races are discovered, such as a start or a certain
                    share of competitors having rounded a mark. This also means that races already
                    loaded will not have their existing data commented on. But (re-)loading races
                    as well as live races into selected events will add those comments, visible in
                    the "Tags" side bar in the race viewer.<p>
                    Two optional system properties can be used to control the AI Agent:
                    <ul>
                    <li><tt>sap.aicore.credentials</tt>: if provided, its value is expected to be a JSON document with AI Core
                        credentials, as you would get from viewing your credentials of you AI Core instance in SAP BTP Cockpit;
                        if not provided, credentials may still be provided through the Admin Console later.</li>
                    <li><tt>sap.sailing.aiagent.modelname</tt>: if provided, selected a language model name to use; a model
                        deployment by that name must be available in the AI Core account for which the credentials are valid.
                        If not provided, or if no model deployment by that name can be found, a default model is used
                        (currently gpt-4o-mini). Note that the model you choose this way needs to comply with the <tt>openai</tt>
                        API for <tt>chat-completions</tt> in order to be used in this context.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>The Administration Console now allows you to configure trusted origins / domains for using Cross-Origin Resource Sharing
                    (CORS) and hence access, in particular, REST API resources from the server or replica set you are administering, as well as
                    the possibility to embed pages from that server or replica set in some other page's &lt;iframe&gt; HTML element,
                    controlled through the <tt>Content-Security-Policy</tt> header field and its <tt>frame-ancestors</tt> directive.
                    Both, wildcard or explicit sets of origins in the form of <tt>https://www.example.org</tt> can be specified.
                    CORS restrictions map to corresponding values of the <tt>Access-Control-Allow-Origin</tt> HTTP response header field.
                    You can find these new options <a href="/gwt/AdminConsole.html#LocalServerPlace:">here in the Advanced / Local Server</a>
                    panel of the Administration Console.<p>
                    Note that the settings you make there are specific to the replica set / server name of the environment you're
                    administering.<p>
                    Also note that with the introduction of these configuration options, there are new, secure defaults. CORS
                    requests are now by default allowed only from the same origin as the REST request goes to, and frame embedding
                    is by default disabled. Should you have a scenario in which you have embedded Sailing Analytics pages in your
                    web site using an &lt;iframe&gt; and would like to continue doing this, please get in touch
                    (<a href="mailto:support@sapsailing.com">support@sapsailing.com</a>).<p>
                    Note that this additional configuration data changes the format of the Security Service's initial load
                    for replication incompatibly. A synchronized roll-out approach is required, upgrading primary/master
                    nodes before upgrading their replica(s).</li>
                <li>File uploads now not only require an authenticated user to have object creation permissions on the
                    target server, but additionally the user's e-mail address now must have been validated successfully.</li>
                <li>New passwords now need to have a higher minimum complexity than before.</li>
                <li>There is a new system property <tt>geonames.org.usernames</tt> that can be used to provide one or more
                    (comma-separated) user names for the <a href="https://geonames.org">geonames.org</a> service that we
                    use to map coordinates to venue names and to determine time zones for races as used, e.g., in
                    data mining.</li>
          </ul>
          <h2 class="articleSubheadline">February 2025</h2>
          <ul class="bulletList">
                <li>In the <a href="/gwt/AdminConsole.html#SmartphoneTrackingPlace:">admin console's</a>
                    Smartphone Tracking panel, when importing data from files to create new device mappings
                    there is now a "Vakaros" / "VAKAROS_EXTENDED" menu entry when using "Import fixes"
                    or "Import additional sensor data," respectively. With these, files obtained from
                    Vakaros devices can be imported with their time stamps, GPS information (lat/lon,
                    COG, SOG) and, when available, from the "additional" sensor data heel, pitch,
                    and the two special values load_GDF1 and load_GDF2, which we map to the
                    forestay load and the kicker tension values, respectively.</li>
                <li>When upgrading an application replica set through the Landscape Management panel,
                    other target groups such as those from an NLB will be considered correctly for adding
                    and removing temporary upgrade replicas and the primary/master node.</li>
                <li>Added a result importer for the typical Sailwave HTML output, such as
                    <a href="https://www.rhkyc.org.hk/storage/app/media/Sailing/result/HONG-KONG-RACE-WEEK/2025/ILCA4.htm">https://www.rhkyc.org.hk/storage/app/media/Sailing/result/HONG-KONG-RACE-WEEK/2025/ILCA4.htm</a>.
                    You can add these types of URLs now in the <a href="/gwt/AdminConsole.html#ResultImportUrlsPlace:">Result import URLs</a> tab
                    of the Connectors category in the administration console.</li>
          </ul>
          <h2 class="articleSubheadline">January 2025</h2>
          <ul class="bulletList">
                <li>When exporting wind from the Admin Console's Tracked Races / Tracked Races panel,
                    the wind data is represented as "fixes" where COG and SOG correspond to TWD and TWS,
                    as usual. Now, however, not only the <tt>COMBINED</tt> wind track is exported, but
                    all detailed tracks of type <tt>EXPEDITION</tt>, <tt>WEB</tt>, <tt>WINDFINDER</tt>,
                    and <tt>RACECOMMITTEE</tt>. The respective object names are constructed from the
                    wind source types and IDs, e.g., <tt>"EXPEDITION (DC-FE-AAHJ)"</tt> and can be
                    imported again in the Tracked Races / Wind panel now (see "Routeconverter"-based
                    wind import).</li>
                <li>Fixed wind import from ZIP files exported by the Sailing Analytics. So far, file extensions
                    of the files wrapped in the ZIP file were checked to be ".txt" which therefore ignored the
                    .gpx, .kml, etc. file types that we normally export ourselves.</li>
          </ul>
          <h2 class="articleSubheadline">December 2024</h2>
          <ul class="bulletList">
                <li>The Igtimi WindBot connector has been re-designed. This became necessary because
                    Riedel Communications GmbH deprecated and then stopped their "Riot" back-end
                    which so far allowed WindBot and YachtBot devices to register, send their data to and provide
                    client applications access to live and historic WindBot data.<p>
                    The new architecture features a built-in "Riot" server replacement in every
                    Sailing Analytics server. It can be configured using the <tt>igtimi.riot.port</tt>
                    system property, which is controlled through the <tt>IGTIMI_RIOT_PORT</tt>
                    environment variable set for the <tt>start</tt> script. When left empty,
                    the Riot server will listen on a random port unused so far. This port can
                    be obtained using the <tt>/igtimi/api/v1/server</tt> REST GET method, found
                    in the <tt>port</tt> attribute of the JSON document responded with.
                    The built-in Riot server is replicated by default, and devices and data access
                    windows are kept synchronized between primary and replicas. Dedicated instances
                    may be set up with the only purpose of acting as a highly-available Riot server
                    farm. Messages sent to one of the instances in the replica set will make it to
                    all instances in the replica set and will eventually get stored persistently in
                    the primary's database.
                    <p>
                    Devices can be configured to send to that port, directly to the server's IP
                    address with the specific port, or, e.g., through a network load balancer
                    such as the Amazon Web Services (AWS) NLB, allowing for multiple servers
                    such as a primary/master and one or more replicas to be registered for
                    high availability. With an AWS NLB it is important to configure the target group
                    such that the client IP address is preserved, so the server knows where to send
                    responses and commands to.
                    <p>
                    Instead of managing Igtimi "Accounts" there now is a system property <tt>igtimi.base.url</tt>
                    that defines the base URL of the Riot service to which the Sailing Analytics server will
                    connect for live and stored WindBot data. The new environment variable <tt>IGTIMI_BASE_URL</tt>
                    is mapped to the <tt>igtimi.base.url</tt> property in the start scripts.
                    The property defaults to <tt>https://wind.sapsailing.com</tt>.
                    By default, authentication for the remote service is handled using the local user's bearer token
                    of the user tracking or owning the race for which wind data is requested. The <tt>igtimi.bearer.token</tt>
                    system property can be used as an override, e.g., in case the local Sailing Analytics server
                    does not share the security service with the replica set running the Riot service. The corresponding
                    environment variable is <tt>IGTIMI_BEARER_TOKEN</tt>. With this,
                    the <tt>igtimi.client.id</tt> and <tt>igtimi.client.secret</tt> system properties, as well as
                    their environment variable counterparts <tt>IGTIMI_CLIENT_ID</tt> and <tt>IGTIMI_CLIENT_SECRET</tt>,
                    respectively, are no longer used.
                    <p>
                    The new version of the Igtimi Devices panel in the Admin Console (see
                    <tt>/gwt/AdminConsole.html#IgtimiDevicesPlace:</tt>) now shows the devices
                    and their sharing to clients through so-called "Data Access Windows." The
                    device entities are created automatically when messages are received.
                    Data Access Windows (DAWs), however, need to be created manually in order to share
                    the content delivered by the devices with authenticated users. You can use
                    the DAWs' ownership and access control list (ACL) settings and grant users
                    explicit permissions to individual DAWs. Click on the "Change Ownership" action icon
                    to see the key of a DAW in case you want to use it in an individual permission
                    that you grant to a user.
                    <p>
                    There is a REST API that mimics the old Riot REST API to a certain degree.
                    Sailing Analytics users and operators typically don't work with this API directly.
                    Yet, the API is exposed under <tt>/igtimi/api/v1</tt> and has end points for
                    managing devices and DAWs, retrieving data recorded from the devices,
                    as well as for finding out the web socket server end
                    point for connecting to live data and connecting to it,
                    and the above-mentioned method for finding
                    out the Riot server socket's listening port.
                    <p>
                    The protocol used for transmitting device data to REST API clients has changed in
                    so far that the device message payloads are no longer sent as JSON objects; instead,
                    the original Protocol Buffer (protobuf) binary messages are encoded using Base64
                    and transmitted as an array of such Base64 strings.

                <li>The system property for removing the SAP branding from the solution has changed its default. It used
                    to default to <tt>false</tt>, meaning that by default the entire solution shows SAP's branding.
                    Prior to publishing the repository under an open-source license we'd like to make clear that only
                    SAP-reviewed versions such as from <a href="https://github.com/SAP/sailing-analytics">https://github.com/SAP/sailing-analytics</a>
                    are supposed to show this branding. Any other fork must not, and the regular rules for the use of
                    the SAP trademark apply. See also <a href="https://brand.sap.com">brand.sap.com</a>.
                    Therefore, we change the default value of this property to <tt>true</tt>.</li>

            <li>When removing the denotation for smartphone tracking from a race, tracking of that race will
                now be stopped and the tracked race will be removed. This ensures consistency when later
                the denotation should be added again.</li>
            <li>A file importer for the Queclink GL300 format (see, e.g.,
                <a target="_" href="https://static.sapsailing.com/GL300%20@Track%20Air%20Interface%20Protocol_R13.03.pdf">here</a>)
                has been added. This way, you can now create a "smartphone-tracked" race and import a file that contains
                messages recorded from GL300 devices. Those messages look like this:
                <pre>
                  +BUFF:GTFRI,301201,860599002480051,,0,0,4,1,,,,-2.872803,52.161116,20240710154359,,,,,,1,,,,-2.872803,52.161116,20240710154404,,,,,,1,,,,-2.872803,52.161116,20240710154409,,,,,,1,,,,-2.872803,52.161116,20240710154414,,,,,,60,,21B0$
                </pre>
                The importer naturally supports out of order delivery. The position-related data doesn't have to be
                ordered by increasing time stamps. This way, you can also activate buffering in your GL300 such that
                when the tracker comes online again, live data transmission takes precedence over transmitting the
                data buffered.</li>

            <li>Introduced a new scoring scheme: "Low point system; Medal races as quarter final, semi final and grand final."
                It is well-suited for the iQFOil format as seen in the years 2022/2023. Model each of the Quarter Final,
                Semi Final, and Grand Final as a separate "Medal Series" with one race each. The scoring scheme understands
                that the best competitor of the opening series advances to the last medal series (e.g., "Grand Final"), and
                the second and third of the Opening Series advance straight to the Semi Final (last-but-one medal series).</li>
            <li>The invalid result markers (IRMs) <tt>SCP</tt>, <tt>STP</tt>, <tt>DPI</tt>, and <tt>RDG</tt> can now consider
                optional incremental score corrections which are added to the points determined based on the competitor's rank
                in the race and the scoring scheme that applied to the race. For example, a <tt>DPI</tt> penalty with <tt>+2.5</tt>
                points may now be specified which applied during tracking the race. Absolute score corrections will be considered
                for these IRMs at the end of the race, regardless the incremental score correction. Note that the increments
                are subject to any column factors being applied; this may contradict an event's rules that may state that certain
                penalties, such as <tt>STP</tt> are <em>not</em> subject to doubling for a medal race. In such cases, specify half
                the penalty when editing the increment. Specifying and incremental penalties can be done on the <tt>/gwt/LeaderboardEdit.html</tt>

                in brackets behind the score and an optional IRM code, as in "17 DPI [+1.5]". Clearing the corresponding field
                in the editing popup dialog removes the incremental scoring offset, just like clearing the IRM code drop-down

          <ul class="bulletList">
            <li>When importing results, sorting of the result documents has been improved. The drop-down now puts those
                result documents at the top that have the relatively longest match of their class name with the regatta's
                class name, also now considering all alias names for the class known to the system. For equally likely
                matches the newer result document is preferred. The score importer used last is remembered in the
                user preferences now and suggested by default. The most likely result document from that "default"
                score provider is suggested for import if the boat class name has sufficient overlap with the leaderboard's
                boat class name.</li>
            <li>In the Admin Console Regattas section, the table now features a course area column. This was previously shown
                in the Leaderboards table only. 
            <li>Handling an error condition more "gracefully:" when in the "Low Point, First to Win Three Races in Final" a competitor
                was assigned a number of carried wins, but that competitor then did not compete in either of the semi-final fleets, an internal
                error would keep the entire leaderboard from displaying. This is now ameliorated by logging a warning and sorting
                such a competitor as "worse" than others with equal points/wins.</li>
            <li>When archiving a DNS-mapped replica set, the load balancer rules were removed only after even the master process
                was stopped. Furthermore, all replicas were stopped even if the master was not part of the public target group, before
                the load balancer rules were changed. This led to the unfortunate situation that
                the reverse-proxy rule that was already active would not get triggered until the load balancer rules
                for the replica set were finally removed, letting users receive error 500 status codes.
                Now, the master is first added to the public target group if it wasn't already a part of it, then all replicas are stopped,
                then the load balancer rules are removed, and then the master is stopped. This will increase availability, particularly
                during a replica set archiving process.</li>
            <li>In the landscape management panel it is now also possible to provide an already existing AWS session token together with
                access key and secret for logging in. This can help, e.g., when a corporate standard requires signing in with non-IAM
                roles or accounts where the typical IAM MFA login is not supported. See your <tt>~/.aws/credentials</tt> file for a possible
                session token and see, for example, the <tt>aadawscli</tt> tool for producing such session credentials from an Azure
                Active Directory authentication scheme.</li>
            <li>Igtimi wind import now will trigger un-archiving of archived wind data. From the Igtimi web site: "All resources stored on the
                Igtimi servers will be archived if they are older than 6 months and have not been accessed for 4 months. When data is archived
                it is flagged as''“is_archived = true''". Note that when you hit archived data, while unarchiving is triggered, it will happen
                in the background and take up to a few minutes. You will then have to try again to actually receive the unarchived data.</li>

          <ul class="bulletList">
            <li>When a user with landscape management permissions creates a new application replica set, e.g., for a new event and the user group created
                for the new server ("...-server") is also new then the user creating it will now automatically be assigned the role <tt>server_admin</tt>
                qualified for the new "...-server" group
                which will allow him / her to manage all technical aspects of the server. The role is assigned "transitively" so that the user may pass
                it on to other delegate users. This complements the transitive assignment of the <tt>user</tt> role qualified for the new "...-server"
                group which the user creating a group has always received, also before this update. See
                <a href="https://wiki.sapsailing.com/wiki/info/security/permission-concept">https://wiki.sapsailing.com/wiki/info/security/permission-concept</a>
                for more details.</li>
            <li>When removing a replica set, now the selection in the table showing the MongoDB endpoints is honored: when a selection has been made there,
                after successfully removing the replica set, its master database will be moved to the MongoDB endpoint selected and will, after successful
                comparison with the original, be removed from its original location. Likewise, a new parameter is available for the corresponding
                REST API endpoint for removing replica sets.</li>
            <li>An STP or SCP scoring code ("Standard Penalty" / "Scoring Penalty") now by default adds 1.0 to the competitor's score as calculated based on the ranking.
                The STP / SCP code is shown already with the beginning of the race, but any official scoring result entered after the race will be
                used during replay only once the competitor has finished the race. For the medal stages of the new Formula Kite scoring
                (Low Point, First to Win Three Races, both, the A8.1 and A8.2 variants) an STP / SCP will add 1.1 to the competitor's score.</li>
            <li>The "Low Point, First to Win Three Races" scoring schemes, which rank competitors in the medal series based on the number of
                "races won" now count a win if the competitor has achieved the lowest score in that race. This changes the previous rule where
                the competitor needed to score 1.0 points in order to be called the "winner" of that race. In particular, with this change
                a competitor with, say, 2.0 points can be the "winner" of the race in case the competitor finishing first took a standard
                penalty (STP) or scoring penalty (SCP) which adds 1.1 points to the 1.0 point awarded for finishing first, so a total of 2.1 points, thus worse
                than the 2.0 points of the competitor finishing second. Should there still be a tie on points, the finishing order is
                used to break that tie.</li>

            <li>Users with administrative permissions on a server replica set will now be notified by e-mail about important
                events affecting the replica set, such as when the primary server instance is upgraded or moved and hence
                the replica set temporarily cannot accept write requests, or when the replica set is being archived and
                hence no other archiving should be run at the same time and the replica set being archived should not be
                modified during the archiving process. The <tt>SERVER</tt> permissions checked are <tt>CAN_IMPORT_MASTERDATA</tt>
                and <tt>CAN_EXPORT_MASTERDATA</tt> for the archiving process, and <tt>CONFIGURE_LOCAL_SERVER</tt> in case of
                the primary server becoming unavailable. E-Mail is sent only to addresses that were previously validated
                successfully.
            </li>
            <li>The landscape management panel in the administration console now offers a new action to move all application
                processes away from a server instance to a new one of which the user can determine the instance type.
                This is helpful, e.g., when a shared instance has an outdated image / installation, requires kernel updates
                or other things that at least would require a re-boot. Instead, moving to a new instance which is launched
                off the latest default image gives a fresh platform to launch the application processes on.
            </li>
            <li>The list of Amazon Machine Images in the landscape management panel now shows the AMI ID as a link that
                will open an AWS console, showing the instances launched off that AMI. This way it becomes easy to see
                which instances are using which of the managed AMIs.
            </li>
            <li>SSH keys produced with new versions of OpenSSH as well as the highly secure ED25519 keys are now supported
                for AWS landscape management. This removes the requirement to convert new OpenSSH keys to PEM format before
                starting to work with them.
            </li>
            <li>For the DNS name resulting from a new replica set name and an optional domain name or the default domain name
                (<tt>sapsailing.com</tt>) it is now checked that this name is not taken yet. An error message will be shown
                otherwise.
            </li>
            <li>Sorting of replica-set table by name is now case-insensitive.</li>
            <li>Bug fix: when working cross-region with the Landscape panel, temporary upgrade replicas were identified
                trying to obtain their host name from their IP address. When this is attempted, however, for an IP address
                identifying a host in one region and the host name is determined from within another region then the
                internal DNS name chosen is that of the other region and therefore incorrect. Instead, now the IP address's
                numeric representation is used instead.</li>
            <li>The scoring scheme "Low Point System, First with three wins in medals is winner" has been adjusted to meet the
                Olympic requirements; see official ORIS document OG2024_SAL_ORIS_R8_V1.2_20230330.pdf. It should be used as follows:
                An opening series, optionally split into qualification and final series in case the fleet is split, is followed
                by two medal series: one for the semi-final, and another for the grand final. Both of these medal series should
                start with a carry-forward which will be interpreted by the scoring scheme as the "number of wins carried forward."
                These carried wins need to be entered manually into the leaderboard (two wins for the best-seeded, one for the
                second-best seeded competitor for each fleet in those medal series). The semi-final series should consist of
                two fleets (A/B, equal rank 0) and will need seven race columns in addition to the carry-forward column because
                four competitors will race for the first to take three wins (defined as score 1.0 by the document), with a total
                of three carried wins may take six races at most, but due to a  standard penalty (STP) no competitor may score a
                win in the first race of a semi-final fleet.<p>
                The grand-finalists also race for the first to take three wins (including the carried-forward wins). They are
                ranked by wins, then by the last race rank, then by the second-to-last race rank and so on, up to the first
                grand-final race, and then by the opening series rank. Likewise, the semi-finalists will be ranked in their
                respective semi-final fleet. For their overall rank of the competitors ranking 2nd to 4th in their semi-final
                the two equally-ranked competitors from fleets A and B will be compared based on their opening series rank.</li>

            <li>Support for managing sharded replication in the "Landscape" panel of the "Advanced" category in the
                <a href="https://www.sapsailing.com/gwt/AdminConsole.html#LandscapeManagementPlace:">admin console</a>),
                offered as a new icon in the "Action" column of the replica sets table: in the new dialog that pops
                up you can create and remove so-called "shards" to which you can assign zero or more leaderboards
                offered by that replica set. Each shard gets its own auto-scaling group and target group in addition to the regular
                auto-scaling group / target group pair used for the public target group. By default a minimum of two instances
                are required by each shard to ensure availability. They are created with the same launch template
                used by the replica set's regular public target group. When a shard's instances are healthy,
                rules are managed in the replica set's load balancer to route traffic regarding the leaderboards
                selected for the shard to the shard's target group. This reduces traffic on the default public
                target group, and the instances of the shard can focus on the sub-set of leaderboards configured
                instead of having to compute all leaderboards in parallel. This helps reduce the leaderboard
                re-calculation times for live events with parallel live races in several classes and tens of
                competitors per leaderboard.

            <li>New scoring scheme for the 2024 Olympic Kite format, called
                "Low Point System, First with three wins in medals is winner": it uses regular low point
                scoring for the opening series (anything up to and excluding any medal series race) with
                the usual RRS A8.1 tie breaking; for any subsequent sequence of medal series the scheme
                counts the wins, and a non-discardable carry column starting a medal series is taken to
                mean "wins carried into that series," not points. A competitor is said to have "won" a
                race if no other competitor scored better in that race, including any penalty points or
                other score corrections. Should this definition apply to more than one competitor, e.g.,
                because all competitors got disqualified, were OCS or DNF, or because the first to cross
                the finish line received an STP of one point and hence scores equal to the competitor
                crossing the finish line in second position, then a winner is picked randomly. To decide
                a winner in this case, a manual score correction in favor of the desired winner is required.<p>
                In the net points sum column, the leaderboard will show wins, not points,
                for competitors who sailed in the medal series. Tie breaking for medal series competitors
                is first by the index of the medal series competed in (finalists rank better than semi-finalists
                who did not sail in the final); second by the number of wins; third by the score obtained
                in the competitors last medal race; and fourth by the rank obtained in the opening series.</li>

            <li>A new leaderboard type is now available which can refer to another leaderboard for tie-breaking.
                An example could be the Formula Kite rules where the high-point medal stage leaderboard is required

                leaderboard, the tie-breaking leaderboard functionality will simply be ignored, making it equivalent
                in behavior to the simpler "High Point System, Match Racing" scoring scheme. It does not by default double
                scores in medal race columns. Instead of a regular RRS A8.1 score comparison based on sorting all

            <li>Note: the new "paywall" has been activated. There is a new role called "premium" that
                paying users can obtain. In case you have security super-powers you can add this role
                to an event's user group and imply it to all its users if you want to relieve this event
                from the restrictions of the paywall. Other than that we hope for your understanding
                regarding the introduction of this subscription-based model as it helps us to keep the
                SAP Sailing Analytics alive and available to you.</li>

                the replication operations based on their lock contention and parallelizing only those that

          <ul class="bulletList">
            <li>The policy for selecting replication instances can now be switched for running replica sets.
                Users now have the possibility to switch from a replica running on a shared instance to
                the use of dedicated replica instances, fully managed by the auto-scaling group. Conversely,
                a replica set using only fully-managed dedicated replica instances can be switched (back)
                to a more cost-efficient, yet still highly available replica running on a shared instance
                if workload does not require additional replicas launched by the auto-scaling group.</li>
            <li>A replica set's master process can now be moved to a different instance. Users can choose
                between moving to a shared or a dedicated instance. With this, a replica set that started
                out in an inexpensive shared set-up can me modified so that it uses a dedicated master instance.
                Furthermore, with this a scale-up and scale-down for the instance hosting the master process
                is now supported.</li>
            <li>Added a Remove button for application replica sets that is mutli-selection aware.</li>
            <li>The instance type of the replicas managed by a replica set's auto-scaling group can now be
                modified, and one by one, the replicas in the set managed by the auto-scaling group will
                be migrated to the new instance type, always keeping at least as many replicas available
                as there were when the action was started. Available as action icon and as multi selection-aware

            <li>Landscape management now offers to upgrade auto-scaling groups after an AMI update.</li>
            <li>Replica sets can now also be managed on shared instances. This goes for new master processes which
                can be deployed into the instance hosting another replica set's master process, or into a new
                instance prepared for being shared. Alternatively to having the auto-scaling group provide a
                dedicated first replica to increase availability, users can now choose to have a replica be deployed
                to a shared instance that runs in an availability zone different from that of the one hosting the
                replica set's master process. If no such shared instance with the port required by the new
                replica set available, a new one is created in an availability zone other than the one hosting
                this replica set's master process, and the first replica is deployed onto that.<p>
                With these steps, operators are now able to set up new replica sets using only shared
                instances when starting. While auto-scaling replicas will still be launched into new
                dedicated instances when the workload requires it, small-scale set-ups with low workloads
                can now be mapped very cost-effectively.</li>

			<li>Added "Elan 350" boat class</li>
			<li>Added "IRC" as a class</li>
			<li>Fixed issue with mixed-up boat ID and competitor ID during competitor import</li>
			<li>A new experimental connector for YellowBrick is now provided. Provide a "race URL" such
			    as "rmsr2021" to start tracking a race. It is advisable to import competitors up-front.
			    A CSV file, as exported, e.g., from Excel, that has the column headers
			    <ul>
			      <li>Race Name</li>
			      <li>Sail Number</li>

			      <li>ORC only</li>
			      <li>YellowBrick Name</li>
			      <li>Competitor ID</li>
			    </ul>
			    will be parsed properly. The "YellowBrick Name" column must contain the name
			    exactly as it appears in the YellowBrick API for the boat. The "Competitor ID"
			    column must be constructed as "YB-{raceURL}-{YellowBrick Name}". For example,
			    if your race URL is "rmsr2021" and a competitor has the YellowBrick Name "BAIT" then
			    the "Competitor ID" must be "YB-rmsr2021-BAIT".<p>
			    The IRC column holds the handicap ToT / TMF / TCC value (e.g., 1.013) The "cat-IRC"
			    is a category / classification, such as "Class 5" which will show in the competitor
			    import as a suggestion for the fleet name. MOCRA, DH, and ORC only are columns which
			    may be empty or have any non-empty string such as "x", indicating that the competitor
			    is competing in the MOCRA, Double-Handed, and/or ORC class. If the "cat-IRC" is "undefined"
			    then "ORC only" competitors will have "ORC" suggested as the race name and fleet name.<p>
			    The connector will ask for new positions every minute which is safely below the request
			    quota of once every five seconds set by YellowBrick. If the newest fix is more than 24h
			    old, the tracker stops requesting new positions automatically.
			</li>
			<li>It is now possible to copy course marks, course definitions and marks' tracking device
			    associations from one regatta to another. Use the "Copy Course and Competitors" action icon
			    in the "Connectors - Smartphone Tracking" race column list bottom left.</li>

                            which selects and filters for a single leaderboard group.
                            The <tt>selectExact</tt> parameter will usually select fewer line items than the <tt>select</tt> parameter because it tries to match its value with the whole column value:

                            If <tt>filter</tt> and <tt>select</tt> parameter values are the same, you can replace it with the <tt>filterAndSelect</tt> parameter:

                            You can combine all the <tt>filter</tt> and <tt>select</tt> parameters by using the ampersand-character. Example:

                            Use URL-encoding for special characters in the parameter values. See class <tt>FilterAndSelectParameters</tt> for a full documentation of the filter and select-parameters.

                        <li>On replicas, user group memberships did not always update correctly, due to a reference to a stale
                            user store received with the initial load when replication starts up. This problem has been fixed now.</li>
                        <li>Under "Race Manager App" the device configurations now offer additional options to pre-configure a device
                            for a particular event, a specific course area of the event, and an optional role/priority such as
                            "Officer on vessel" or "Shore control". The QR-code and link produced are in a new format that is
                            understood starting with Race Manager App version 1.4.91 and which supports installing the app
                            and still recognizing the configuration upon the first app start ("deep link support").</li>

                            connectivity parameters. As an effect, by default after the Master Data Import completes, all
                            races of the event(s) imported will automatically be loaded on the importing side.</li>

                            was modified was still considered registered, and all other objects from the list got de-registered.
                            This has now been fixed.</li>

                            with boat assignments can also be used (without their boat assignments) in regattas
                            where competitors change boats.</li>

                        <li>Remote Server Instance management has been made more selective. So far, all public events
                            ("list on homepage == Yes") on a remote server were featured in the referencing server's
                            event list and stage, as well as in a search operation. Now, administrators can pick and choose
                            from the public event list on the remote server which ones to expose on the referencing side.
                            The list can be including or excluding. Existing remote server references are handled as having
                            and "excluding" with an empty list of events excluded, giving the classic behavior of drawing
                            from all events. When creating new remote references, from now on they will be created as
                            "including" starting out with an empty event list. The administrator hence has to pick events
                            to feature explicitly, and new events added on the remote side will no longer automatically show
                            on the referencing side. An "excluding" remote reference needs to be set up for this "legacy"
                            behavior.</li>
                        <li>Based on user input, the "selected" marker in rows supporting multiple selection now uses
                            a stronger "SAP Blue" color so that selected rows can be recognized even easier.</li>
                        <li>Passwords or secret access keys of file storage configuration are no longer displayed after submitting.</li>
                        <li>Added "aarhus" as new <a href="https://www.windfinder.com">WindFinder</a> spot collection.</li>

                        <li>Leaderboards and regattas used to have a single "default" course area assignment. This caused
                            problems when particularly split-fleet regattas assigned their different fleets to different
                            course areas at the same time. See also
                            <a href="https://bugzilla.sapsailing.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=3465">bug 3465</a>. Now it is
                            possible to select more than one course area from the enclosing event for a regatta and flexible
                            leaderboard. As an immediate effect, the SAP Sailing Race Manager app which uses the course area
                            as a filter for the regattas to display for an event can now see the same regatta on different devices
                            configured for different course areas. For example, if a regatta splits its Gold and Silver fleets
                            to race on course areas Delta and Echo, respectively, then now users of the SAP Sailing Race Manager app
                            will see this regatta when they are logged on to course area Delta or to course area Echo.

                            Manager app or, e.g., the AdminConsole.html start time setting feature, the course area on which the
                            start will happen can be captured in the log entry. If not provided, and if the regatta / leaderboard
                            to whose log the entry is added has exactly one course area configured then that will be the default
                            course area for the race. With this new feature is it possible to specify exactly on which course area
                            a race has started, even if the enclosing regatta uses multiple course areas, either over time or even
                            at the same time. The SAP Sailing Race Manager app now uses the course area to which the user logs on to
                            fill this new field in the start time log entries.

                                <li>A mark role defines the purpose of a mark used in the waypoint sequences of a regatta course or course template and allows to swap out marks or mark templates without changing the the effective waypoint sequence.

                        <li>Added system property <tt>gwt.acceptableCrossDomainStorageRequestOriginRegexp</tt> which can be used to
                            configure which origins are permitted to access the local storage in the server instance. For example,
                            to grant access to the local storage of www.sapsailing.com for all sub-domains of sapsailing.com including
                            sapsailing.com itself, specify
                            the following regular expression:<pre>
                              -Dgwt.acceptableCrossDomainStorageRequestOriginRegexp=https?://(.*\.)?sapsailing\.com$
                            </pre> or, for allowing for an optional port specification, it could be something like<pre>
                              -Dgwt.acceptableCrossDomainStorageRequestOriginRegexp=https?://(.*\.)?sapsailing\.com(:[0-9]*)?$
                            </pre>
                            To represent this in the <tt>env.sh</tt> configuration file for an instance, use, e.g., something like this:<pre>
                                ADDITIONAL_JAVA_ARGS="$ADDITIONAL_JAVA_ARGS -Dgwt.acceptableCrossDomainStorageRequestOriginRegexp=https?://(.*\\.)?sapsailing\\.com\$"
                            </pre>
                            Note the escaping of the backslashes and the $ sign with a preceding backslash character in this Bash
                            syntax.<p>
                            This allows the <tt>iframe</tt> embedded in other instances for cross-domain local storage access to
                            read from the local storage compartment for domain www.sapsailing.com (the example instance configured
                            by the system property shown above) if the other instance's origin ends on ".sapsailing.com".<p>
                            Note that the origin is presented as the scheme (e.g., "https://") plus the hostname, plus optionally
                            the colon-separated port, so you may be seeing something like "https://lyc.sapsailing.com" or
                            "http://127.0.0.1:8888".<p>
                            If the system property is not specified, no origin will be permitted to use this instance's local storage
                            through the cross-domain storage mechanism.

                            The ORC Performance Curve (PCS) ranking metric is now implemented. Two flavors exist, one
                            as valid up until 2015 with ranking by implied wind and corrected times calculated
                            using a scratch boat's performance curve; and the current default one valid starting
                            from 2015, using each competitor's own performance curve to calculate the allowance
                            based on the greatest implied wind achieved in the race and then computing the
                            corrected time as the delta between time elapsed and individual allowance.<p>
                            In the Regattas/Regattas tab the boat certificates can be managed with a new action
                            button. Certificates can be uploaded, and certificates can be referenced by URL,
                            e.g., pointing to the ORC web site's certificate database. Then, the certificates
                            can be assigned to the boats one by one. Certifiate assignment can be overruled on
                            a per-race basis in the Leaderboards/Leaderboards tab.<p>
                            Furthermore, course definitions can be fixed for the ORC PCS rules; legs can be
                            defined to be "constructed course" or any of the pre-defined types (windward/leeward,
                            coastal long distance, non-spinnaker, and circular random). Tracking data can be used
                            to pre-fill leg distance and true wind angle. Desired total course distances can be spread
                            proportionally across the legs based on their estimated length. For more details
                            see <a href="https://wiki.sapsailing.com/wiki/howto/setup-orc-regatta">https://wiki.sapsailing.com/wiki/howto/setup-orc-regatta</a>.

                            Loading a race using the TracTrac connector used to determine the race's boat class
                            based on the boat class of the majority of the race's competitors. This approach leads
                            to trouble specifically for non-one-design regattas where different boats compete against
                            each other, and the regatta is modeled with a "boat class" representing the handicap
                            rule set, such as IRC, ORC, or similar. Now, the race boat class is inferred from the
                            regatta boat class in which the race is created. Only in case a default regatta needs
                            to be created, the old majority rule applies to determining the regatta's (and
                            consequently the race's) boat class.

                        <li>A new wind source that estimates true wind direction and speed from maneuvers is available.
                            It has been trained using machine learning techniques, based on approximately 12 million
                            maneuvers that the SAP Sailing Analytics have tracked and classified so far. It is intended
                            to serve as a fallback wind source in case the wind direction is not being made available
                            to a tracked race in any other way (entry through the Race Manager app, the web page or
                            estimated based on the first upwind leg's direction). Therefore, the confidence level has
                            been set fairly low, hence this wind source will always be outweighed by any real wind
                            sensor out on the course.<p>
                            
                            To make the wind source available in a server, the trained
                            maneuver classification models have to be available in the server's underlying database.
                            To achieve this,
                            the system property parameter <tt>-Dwindestimation.source.url=https://www.sapsailing.com</tt>
                            can be used to import the wind data from the archive server in case no local model
                            exists yet in the server's database. To force loading the data from another server,
                            regardless of whether a model exists in the local server's database, use
                            <tt>-Dwindestimation.source.always.url</tt>, respectively. Alternatively, the model data
                            can be obtained as a file from another server like this: <tt>curl -o windEstimationModels.dat https://www.sapsailing.com/windestimation/api/windestimation_data</tt>.
                            Alternatively, a recent copy is also maintained at <a href="http://static.sapsailing.com/windEstimationModels.dat">http://static.sapsailing.com/windEstimationModels.dat</a>.
                            The resulting file, <tt>windEstimationModels.dat</tt>, can then be uploaded to another server, like this:
                            <tt>curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/octet-stream" --data-binary @windEstimationModels.dat https://username:password@host.sapsailing.com/windestimation/api/windestimation_data</tt>
                            Note that user credentials need to be provided with the request. The user must have the permission
                            <tt>WIND_ESTIMATION_MODELS:UPDATE:&lt;server-name&gt;</tt> for the server to which the
                            model data is to be stored.<p>
                            
                            Subsequent server starts
                            won't need to load the remote model data again because it has been stored in the server's
                            database during the initial import. Replicas will receive the model data from their master.<p>

                            in a short, medium and long time interval (e.g., 5, 30, and 60 seconds, respectively).<p>

                            This can then also be used, e.g., to export these metrics to other tools, such as

                            that can be used to expose JMX data to Prometheus. If the Java VM running the SAP Sailing Analytics

                            were sometimes hard to click because they disappeared behind the boat's tail.
                            This behavior is now fixed.
                        </li>
                        <li>Fixed an issue with result import URL removal in case the URL erroneously contains
                            more than one space character.
                        </li>
                        <li>Fixed a problem with competitor import: competitors imported now correctly obtain
                            the current session's user as their owner, and the current session's user's
                            default creation group as their owning group.
                        </li>
                        <li>Fixed issues with Manage2Sail regatta structure import: Imports of regattas with
                            no "ClassName" property, such as handicap / Yardstick regattas, will now create
                            regattas with "?" as boat class name to avoid other problems; furthermore,
                            due to a permission check that was too restrictive, regattas to import could not
                            be seen unless the user had "super-admin" power.
                        </li>
                        <li>Introduced a new permission SERVER:CAN_EXPORT_MASTERDATA:&lt;server-name&gt;
                            which controls if a user is allowed to export masterdata used by the MDI.
                            In addition, the user still needs to be able to read the data to be imported.
                            On the importing server, the user needs to have the permission SERVER:CAN_IMPORT_MASTERDATA:&lt;server-name&gt;.

                        <li>Filtering the leaderboard groups during a Master Data Import now also
                            handles quoted strings correctly. With this, e.g., searching for a
                            leaderboard group containing "Apr 2" in its name is doable.
                        </li>
                        <li>In AdminConsole.html all tables and lists are now filtered to only show domain objects readable by the current user.
                            This means additional objects may exist on the server and can cause errors due to name conflicts.<br>
                            To allow users to grant others permissions for their stuff, it is possible to manage permissions for users whose username is known without having a read permission for that user.
                            In addition, users may be added to groups by only knowing their username.
                        </li>
                        <li>The permission system was extended to allow groups to directly grant roles to their users.
                            In addition such a role can also be granted to all users (including anonymous ones).
                            Roles associated to groups only grant permissions to domain objects owned by that group.<br>
                            Example: By associating the <tt>sailing_viewer</tt> role to a group with "for all users" enabled, all objects owned by that group are publicly readable.
                        </li>
                        <li>When loading or tracking wind from Igtimi, only accounts readable by the current user will be used.
                            On dedicated event servers, such an account should be owned by the server group.
                            This ensures, that all server admins will consistently use this account while tracking races.
                        </li>
                        <li>Replication is now also secured by several actions of the SERVER security type.
                            Due to permission checks on the master side, it is now necessary to provide credentials of a user that exists
                            on the master server that is used when a replica contacts the master.
                            This user at least needs to have the permission <tt>SERVER:REPLICATE:&amp;server-name&amp;</tt> granted on the master.<br>
                            Server start scripts as well as the replication documentation have been updated to include details about configuring credentials for auto replication.
                            Newly created servers should automatically contain adjusted versions of the relevant scripts.
                            The configuration of existing servers needs to get updated accordingly. The environment variables considered by the
                            start script are: <tt>REPLICATE_MASTER_USERNAME</tt> and <tt>REPLICATE_MASTER_PASSWORD</tt>, or alternatively,
                            <tt>REPLICATE_MASTER_BEARER_TOKEN</tt> which can be obtained from the master server, e.g., by
                            <tt>curl -d "username=myuser&amp;password=mysecretpassword" "https://master-server.sapsailing.com/security/api/restsecurity/access_token" | jq .access_token</tt>.
                            These map to the system properties <tt>replicate.master.username</tt>, <tt>replicate.master.password</tt>, and
                            <tt>replicate.master.bearer_token</tt>, respectively.

                            significantly less CPU power during live situations. Instead of computing the
                            serialized representation of a leaderboard again and again, the serialized version
                            is maintained in the cache as long as the original object from which the serialized
                            version was produced is referenced. This way, the cache cleans itself. It can be
                            observed through JMX, e.g., using JConsole, by looking at the JMX bean

                            by filtering possible mark passing candidates using a bounding box-based approach:
                            if a tracker hardly moves over some time, only the most promising candidates from
                            that time interval are considered. This avoids compute time and memory issues

                            their source will not keep causing permanent restore trouble, and manual database

                            successfully. It reports a 200 HTTP response if itself and the status reports it syndicates

                            This will improve your system's behavior if you run with a MongoDB replica set and have to
                            assume that at some point the PRIMARY MongoDB system may fail, with the remaining systems
                            in the replica set voting for a new PRIMARY. Without retryWrites your system will bluntly
                            fail, but with retryWrites, write operations will be re-tried once, with a timeout usually
                            enough for the remaining replicas to agree on a new PRIMARY.

                            The scoring scheme is named "Low Point System, First with two wins in medals is winner" and introduces the following specifics compared to the standard low point scheme:

                                <li>Medal series does not feature doubling of points in the medal series by default.</li>
                                <li>A competitor having two wins in the medal series is treated as overall winner.
                                    If there is a carry forward column in the medal series, having one point there also counts as a win which means the best competitor in the qualification needs a win less than any other finalist to be the overall winner.</li>
                                <li>If the medal series isn't started yet or no competitor has collected two wins, scoring by points is used.
                                    This also applies if the regatta is aborted (e.g. due to weather conditions) before any competitor could win two races in the medal series.</li>
                                <li>If two competitors have the same amount of points in the medal series the tie breaking criteria is the carry forward column of the medal series.
                                    If there is no carry forward column in the medal series, the last medal race is used as tie breaking criteria.
                                    For any non-medal series, the standard low point rules apply.</li>

                        <li>The URLs of our GWT services are extended to include a leaderboard name if a call is context sensitive to a specific leaderboard.
                            This does not affect the functionality of any service but allows us to setup load balancing with leaderboard specific routing.
                            The leaderboard names put into the URL are cleaned: Any character that isn't a latin upper/lowercase letter or digit is replaced with an underscore character.
                            Currently, the following leaderboard specific URLs are used:
                            <ul>
                                <li>/gwt/service/sailing/leaderboard/[CLEANED-LEADERBOARD-NAME]</li>
                                <li>/gwt/service/dispatch/leaderboard/[CLEANED-LEADERBOARD-NAME]</li>
                            </ul>
                            Be aware that request without leaderboard suffix may be sent from pages that do not show leaderboard specific contents.
                            Due to this it is required to define a fallback rule for any unqualified request.
                            </li>

                        <li>Added the ability to add multiple mp4 videos as mediatracks at once via the new multi video dialog, located at trackedraces -> Audio & Video.
                            This features requires a webserver with index listing enabled. Additionally the dialog offers the ability to add the new mediatracks 
                            directly to all races overlapping the starttime and duration of the mediatrack.</li>
                        <li>On the "Edit mark positions" panel within RaceBoard, now a "Clear selection" button appears
                            when selecting a mark from the table, which provides an easier and more obvious way to
                            deselect all marks, what is needed in order to see the full course with all marks again.</li>
                        <li>The <tt>AutoPlay.html</tt> configuration "Sixty Inch" was improved for the usage with events that aren't part of an event series.
                            While no race is live or scheduled, only the overall leaderboard used to be shown.
                            In addition to this, also the regatta leaderboard is shown in an alternating order.
                            For non series events there is no overall leaderboard which means, that only the regatta leaderboard is shown.</li>

                        <li>The import of additional expedition data was extended to read many additional measures.
                            These can be visualized in the leaderboard as well as the competitor charts in <tt>RaceBoard.html</tt>.
                            In addition, the leaderboard has been extended to provide bravo and expedition related measures consistently on race and leg level.
                            The respective settings dialogs were changed as well to only show specific options, if bravo or expedition tracks are available.
                            Any previously imported expedition tracks may be dropped and reimported to gain access to the newly introduced measures.</li>
                        <li>The settings dialog of the competitor charts in <tt>RaceBoard.html</tt> now provides the measures in alphabetical order (based on the current locale).
                            Expedition specific measures - if available - are shown at the end of the list.</li>
                        <li>The all in one expedition import has been extended to be able to import new competitor tracks or new races to an existing regatta.
                            Previously it was only possible to import a new event structure.</li>
                        <li>The Expedition log file import now prefers "GPS Time" for time stamping over "Utc" and over other date / time formats, making it
                            more consistent with the Expedition live connector which uses column 146 for time stamping which is GPS Time.</li>
                        <li>Two dimensional metrics can now be displayed by using a scatter plot presenter within the data mining tool.
                            Select a metric that returns a pair of numbers and choose "Average" or "Identity" as an aggregator.</li>
                        <li>Replication was made more robust for fixes that are delivered and applied asynchronously. If a race was removed
                            while still in tracking mode, fix-related operations may have been queued already on the replica when the
                            tracked race is removed. The pending GPS fix operations then would have clogged the executor threads until
                            the entire replica comes to a halt. With the change, race-related asynchronous operations will simply be
                            dropped when the race to which they pertain is not found on the replica.</li>
                        <li>When editing mark positions, all fixes are now displayed, including potential outliers.</li>

                    <ul class="bulletList">
                        <li>Boats are now separate entities. See the "Tracked Races / Boats" tab in the admin console.
                            When creating a regatta, you now need to specify whether in that regatta the competitors
                            may sail on changing boats ("Can boats of competitors change per race").
                            If boats can change, boat assignments need to be specified per
                            race. For the TracTrac connector this may happen as in the past, using the corresponding
                            metadata attributes (boatName, either one of boatId or boatUuid, and boatColor) on the
                            competitors in the race. For smartphone tracking, boats can be specified in the
                            "Connectors / Smartphone Tracking" tab by using the boat icon in the actions column of
                            the leaderboards table ("Boat Registrations"). This defines the boats from which you can
                            then select in the scope of each race of the regatta. When adding competitors to such
                            a race then you now have to assign boats from the boats list to each competitor before
                            you can confirm the competitor-to-race assignments.
                        </li>
                        <li>User, role and permission management has been extended. A new "tenant" concept
                            is now available. Users can belong to zero or more tenants and can have a default
                            tenant for a login session. Zero or more users can belong to a tenant. Objects have
                            a tenant owner and a user owner, similar to group and user ownerships of files in a
                            file system.<p>
                            By default, each user receives a default tenant that is named like the user, with "-tenant"
                            appended. This applies during user migration to this new version, as well as during
                            creation of new users. While a "default tenant" only specifies the tenant that objects
                            created by the user will have as their tenant owner, by default the user also "belongs"
                            to its default tenant (is part of that tenant's user group).<p>
                            Roles are now defined explicitly, in the "Roles" tab in the "Advanced" category.
                            A new server that is not sharing the security service with any other server will
                            start out with a few default role definitions, such as "admin" and "user". Roles imply permissions,
                            and the permissions they imply can be modeled in the "Roles" tab.<p>
                            Roles can be assigned to users in the UI-refurbished "User Management" tab in the
                            "Advanced" category. There is now a table with users that currently exist in the
                            system, with a pager and a filter box. Editing a user shows an edit dialog for that
                            user where roles and permissions can be added. Adding permissions works as usual.
                            However, when adding roles, qualifications for a tenant owner and a user owner
                            can be added using the following format for the role's name: &lt;rolename&gt;[:[&lt;tenantname&gt;][:[&lt;username&gt;]]].
                        </li>
                        <li>In addition to track competitors and marks using smartphone-tracking it is now possible to track boats.
                            This is e.g. useful for several national leagues where competitors are assigned dynamically to boats for each race.
                            In this case the competitors were used to bring a smartphone with them to the assigned boat.
                            With the recent changes regarding boat and competitor mapping per race, Smartphone-tracking is now enabled to dynamically track boat-mapped devices to the correct competitors in the context of a race.
                            There are two ways to add boats to be tracked to a regatta:
                            <ul>
                                <li>After adding a denotation to the racelog(s), add competitors to at least one race and ensure that the boats to be tracked are mapped to those</li>
                                <li>Register boats directly to the regatta</li>
                            </ul>
                            For available boats, you can now add mappings and generate a QR code in the corresponding dialog.
                            In addition, it is possible to upload tracking files and map them to boats.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
        
                    <h2 class="articleSubheadline">February 2018</h2>
                    <ul class="bulletList">
                        <li>Further improvements of maneuver detection algorithm were introduced. Mark Passing is no longer regarded as a separate maneuver type. Instead, it is regarded as a supplementary information which gets appended to a maneuver instance. Therefore, a new filtering dimension was added for maneuver data mining, which is boolean and is named as "Mark Passing".</li>
                        <li>Added leaderboard group name as a dimension to a leaderboard's context</li>
                        <li>Added True Wind Angle as a data mining statistic on GPS fixes</li>
                        <li>Time points for wind data related to individual fixes now uses the fixes' specific time points, not the wind at the middle of the leg</li>
                        <li>Finally, the data mining UI sorts wind strengths given in Beaufort according to their strengths, not their names</li>
                            For example, a simple role name such as "admin" will give an unqualified role to the user.
                            To constrain the "admin" role to objects whose tenant owner is the tenant "abc", use
                            "admin:abc" for the role. To assign the role "admin" so that it applies only to objects
                            owner by user "u938" use "admin::u938".<p>
                            Tenants can be managed in the "Tenant Management" tab in the "Advanced" category. Here,
                            tenants can be created, removed and the set of users belonging to each tenant can be
                            edited.<p>
                            During migration of an existing server to this new version, a new default tenant will be
                            created using the server's name. All existing objects will by default have this new default
                            tenant as their tenant owner, and no user owner. All existing role assignments will be migrated
                            such that all roles will have as tenant qualification the new default tenant. This way,
                            users will maintain the rights they were assigned through roles only for those objects
                            belonging to the server's new default tenant (by default all objects on that server).
                            Only when new objects are created with a different tenant then the role's permissions
                            won't apply because the roles were by default constrained to the server's default tenant.
                            This will allow us to consolidate, merge and join the security services of various servers
                            at a later point in time, ensuring that users will not obtain permissions for objects they
                            are not eligible for.

                        <li>In the raceboard the floating video box was improved, leading to a more solid resizing and moving behavior.</li>

                            A new tracked race is then associated to the new column for the fleet of the current race.

                        <li>Authentication for Igtimi accounts is now possible with an OAuth process.
                            Instead of having to enter the username/password combination into the
                            administration console, a popup window will show an IFrame with Igtimi's
                            authentication form. Redirection goes to www.sapsailing.com, together with
                            a "state" URL parameter providing the base URL of the original server instance
                            requesting authentication. www.sapsailing.com will then redirect to that server,
                            removing the "state" parameter from the request and leaving only the "code"
                            parameter in the URL which the server ultimately receiving the redirected request
                            will use to obtain an access token and the Igtimi account details. For now, and
                            as a fallback, the old, non-OAuth process is still supported for a while, though
                            deprecated as of now.
                        </li> 
                        <li>In the process of supporting Igtimi OAuth authentication, new optional system properties for
                            the Igtimi connector have been introduced:
                            <ul>
                              <li><tt>igtimi.client.redirect.protocol</tt>: the redirection protocol, usually one of http or https</li>
                              <li><tt>igtimi.client.redirect.host</tt>: redirection host; defaults to www.sapsailing.com</li>
                              <li><tt>igtimi.client.redirect.port</tt>: redirection port; defaults to empty, using the default port for the protocol</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>When using a TracTrac update URI, errors were possible due to the incorrect use of HTTP
                            instead of HTTPS as the URI/URL's protocol. The TracTrac server responds to an HTTP
                            request with a response code 302 (temporary redirect), but our TracTrac connector did
                            not handle this due to redirects that change protocols are not followed by default in
                            Java. This has now been changed, and although it is of course better to use the correct
                            protocol (HTTPS) right away, redirects will now be handled correctly, too.

                        <li>An NMEA wind import feature is now available under "Tracked Races -- Wind." It can be
                            used to import .txt and .zip files containing data in NMEA-0183 format. The importer
                            recognizes wind data provided by MWD and MDA sentences but can also use apparent and true
                            wind readings from MWV sentences which are then combined with position, heading and motion data
                            to obtain a true wind speed and direction. ZIP files are searched for .txt files which
                            are then analyzed.

                            scores of the competitor in all other flights scored, for past and coming races. This scoring
                            scheme will apply as a default score for an RDG this average. As usual, as soon as an explicit
                            score is provided for the race, the default calculation will no longer be applied.

                    <ul class="bulletList">
                        <li>The logic of the "Control tracking from start and finish times" check box now behaves slightly
                            differently. As before, a default start of tracking time is derived from the race start time
                            (currently five minutes before race start). Likewise, a default end of tracking time is derived
                            from the race finish time (the time when the blue flag was lowered, or more technically,
                            when a FINISHED race state was set in the race log) which is currently two minutes after
                            the race has finished. However, previously, when deviating start of tracking or end of tracking times
                            were set through other channels, such as received from TracTrac or set explicitly through
                            the administration console, new events would have been written to the race log, fixing the
                            start of tracking / end of tracking times according to the derivation rules.<p>
                            This logic has caused undesired effects and has therefore been removed. For example, when
                            an end of tracking time has been set explicitly through the administration console then
                            it may have been overwritten by a new end-of-tracking-time event appended to the race log
                            when the race is loaded again. Similarly, when a new start time was provided, an explicitly
                            set start of tracking time would have been canceled. With the new behavior, explicit settings
                            of start/end of tracking will remain untouched.<p>
                            For "Smartphone Tracking" the check box therefore now mainly controls whether or not a start/end
                            of tracking time is written to the race log when the user starts/stops tracking for the first time
                            through the administration console: when the tracking times are to be controlled by the race's
                            start and finish times, simply starting / stopping to track a race with the smartphone connector won't
                            set the start / end of tracking times.<p>
                            For the TracTrac connector, when the check box is set, as before messages will go out to TracTrac
                            when the race start / finish times have changed. The feedback from TracTrac will adjust the
                            tracking times as received by the connector, but no race log entries for the tracking times
                            will be created anymore.</li>
                        <li>A new type of leaderboard has been introduced: a regatta leaderboard with competitor elimination.
                            Such a leaderboard creates a view onto a regular regatta leaderboard and allows the user to
                            eliminate a subset of the competitors from its display. The scores of all remaining competitors
                            are taken from the original regatta leaderboard without modification, including all
                            corrections, penalties and the discarding rule, including the live ranks. This means,
                            in particular, that the ranks shown for a race in such a leaderboard are not contiguous in
                            case there are eliminated competitors. The score sum for each competitor is computed as usual.
                            For the regatta rank, a contiguous count is applied. This way it is possible to create
                            a new ranking for only a subset of the competitors; a practice common for championships
                            that want to publish a separate youth leaderboard, e.g., for all competitors under a
                            certain age.</li>

                            name. Now, the control point's ID plus a numeric suffic (1/2) is used instead,
                            providing uniqueness at the same scope that TracTrac provides uniqueness regarding
                            their control point IDs.

                            ground, "smaller" data types such as "int" and "short" are now employed. The reduction of accuracy
                            that this brings about is negligible given the accuracy of the tracking systems used. For example,
                            the latitude values are encoded such that while covering the full range from -90Ã‚Â° to +90Ã‚Â°, the
                            resolution is at 4.6mm. Similarly, speeds are represented in their compact form in such a way

                            is written, giving the reason for the failure to load the race. This gives administrators an opportunity
                            to correct any errors in the underlying data and try again. Previously, tracking such a 
                            was not possible without a server re-start because the tracker continued to exist.

                            committed timestamp is revoked (regardless of the contents of the date/time field), allowing for
                            inference to take place if the regatta has been configured for tracking times inference.

                        <li>Partial replication is now possible. If the system property <tt>replicate.on.start</tt>
                            that controls automatic replication upon start-up provides only a partial comma-separated
                            list of replicables, the connection to the master server (configured by the other
                            replication-related system properties such as <tt>replicate.master.servlet.host</tt> etc.)
                            will be used to replicate only those replicables whose IDs are specified in
                            <tt>replicate.on.start</tt>. All other replicables will operate locally.
                            Usually, the <tt>replicate.on.start</tt> system property is controlled
                            by the environment variable <tt>REPLICATE_ON_START</tt> that is set in the <tt>env.sh</tt>
                            configuration file used during server startup and influenced by the server environments
                            from <a href="http://releases.sapsailing.com/environments">http://releases.sapsailing.com/environments</a>
                            and overridden by the user details provided to the instance through the AWS EC2 machinery.<p>
                            The Administration Console (<tt>/gwt/AdminConsole.html</tt> entry point) will now
                            show which replicables a replica replicates, both, on the replica's administration
                            console's "Replication" panel, as well as on the master's "Replication" panel, there
                            for each replica.<p>
                            The master will restrict broadcasting its operations to those replicables for which
                            at least one replica has subscribed. While the initial load is requested individually
                            for each replica and can therefore be tailored to the replicas requested, the operation
                            broadcast channel is not specific to any replica. It therefore contains the operations
                            of all replicables for which at least one replica has subscribed. Replicas receiving
                            operations for replicables for which they did not subscribe will simply drop those
                            operations (note, however, that the replica will still have to read the operations from the
                            channel before dropping; this way, registering a replica may have bandwidth effects for
                            other replicas). Similarly, "backward replication" from a replica to a master will only
                            take place for those replicables for which the replica has requested replication from (and
                            therefore also "to") the master.<p>
                            With this it is now possible to replicate only the Security Service, using ID
                            <tt>com.sap.sse.security.impl.SecurityServiceImpl</tt>, running all other replicables
                            in "master mode." This will let the instance share user, permission, role and session management
                            details with the instance from which the Security Service is being replicated while
                            having its own master objects for all other replicables, such as the sailing application
                            (RacingEventService),  mail service or the polar data service. Note that with this feature
                            the server replicating another instance's Security Service will grant the roles and permissions
                            to subjects authenticated against that replicated Security Service. For example, if a user
                            has been granted the <tt>admin</tt> role by that service then the user has that role also
                            in all other server instances replicating that Security Service. Therefore, use this feature
                            with extreme caution. Keep in mind that in the near future we will extend the permissions and
                            role concept by the possibility to restrict permissions and roles to "scopes" such as an
                            event or a regatta or an account. See also

                        <li>The server can now optionally restore all races it had tracked the last time. This is
                            similar to a web browser's capability to restore the tabs the user had open when the browser
                            was terminated or crashed. To enable this feature, use the system property
                            <tt>restore.tracked.races</tt>, using the command line option <tt>-Drestore.tracked.races=true</tt>.
                            So far, the default for this system property is <tt>false</tt>, so by default, when the property
                            is not provided at all on the command line then the tracked races loaded last won't be restored,
                            and the server will start out with an empty set of tracked races.<p>
                            Note that the wind tracking properties, as set when initially tracking the race, are also restored
                            to their last state. If a live race has last been tracked with live wind tracking, with wind directions
                            being corrected by the local magnetic declination, then upon server restore the same live tracking will
                            be started again, including live wind tracking with the same declination correction settings.<p>
                            When the "Stop Tracking" feature is used, implicitly tracking wind will be stopped in case live wind
                            tracking had previously been requested for that race. This change is also considered during the restore
                            process where such a race will no longer receive live wind tracking upon restoring it.<p>
                            When a tracked race is removed from the server then it will not be restored anymore upon the next
                            server restart with the restore option enabled. When an entire regatta with a number of tracked
                            races linked into it is removed then the tracked races are removed as well and will not be
                            restored upon server re-start.<p>
                            The restore progress can be monitored using the JConsole or any other JMX monitoring tool. In the
                            <tt>com.sap.sailing</tt> category you will find the <tt>RacingEventService</tt> object. Among its
                            attributes there are now the two new ones: <tt>NumberOfTrackedRacesToRestore</tt> and

                           and question to the user is issued, strongly suggesting the use of the "By Marks" course
                           designer. Background: using the "By Name" course designer could accidentally delete a
                           valid course layout.
                       </li>
                       <li>Regattas now have an additional setting: "Control tracking from start and finish times."
                           With it, the start and finish times for a race as entered into the race log, e.g., through
                           the Race Management app, can be used by tracking connectors to control the tracking for
                           that race. So far, the TracTrac connector and the Smartphone connector have been
                           enabled. When a start time for a race
                           is received and the "Control..." flag is set, the tracking start time will be set to
                           five minutes before the race start time. Similarly, when the blue flag is lowered, signaling
                           that the race has finished, the tracking end time will be set to two minutes later.
                           This should make an operator's job easier when the race timing is maintained properly
                           through the race log, i.e., through the Race Management app.<p>
                           In turn, for the Smartphone tracking connector, start/end tracking times are recorded
                           automatically upon start and stop tracking actions only if the regatta is <em>not</em>
                           marked as "Control tracking from start and finish times." Background: with this it is
                           possible to start tracking for a number of races scheduled for a day and having the
                           Race Management app control the tracking times automatically.

                            means an open-ended interval, and fixes at or after the start of tracking time point will then
                            continue to be accepted.

                        </li>
                        <li>Thread management has been improved. Fewer and more reasonably-designed thread pools
                            are now created, and thread priorities less than normal (for background operations) now
                            correctly map to operating system thread priorities, making foreground tasks more
                            responsive. The less excessive concurrency has furthermore healthy effects on memory
                            mamangement and garbage collection.

                            on tracking races via racelog event but is bound to denotation only. So fix-tracking
                            via smartphone apps or uploading tracking files can also be used in combination with

                            a mark's position to a fixed lat/lng for some time point in the past.

                            series. When combined with leaderboard-wide discards, generally discards can be distributed
                            across the leaderboard as needed, but restricted by the maximum specified for each series.
                            Leave the maximum empty to not provide any maximum. Setting to 0 will cause no scores to
                            be discarded in that series.

                        <li>An event now has a "Base URL" which should be used to enable useful e-mail notifications with
                            links embedded in them that lead to the correct server. If a notification is to contain
                            a link to a dedicated event server, the event cannot be reached through www.sapsailing.com,
                            and so if this generic link is used as a default, users will end up not finding the page
                            linked to by the notification.

                       <li>Some REST APIs have slightly changed. The /api/v1/leaderboards/{name} resource now
                           has the "netPoints" and "totalPoints" stuff right. The "netPoints" always refer to
                           scores which may be reduced due to discarding rules. Total points always refer to
                           the points before applying any discarding rules. Those numeric values for which so far
                           accidentally String types with double-quoted values were used have been changed to
                           numeric types, represented in the JSON documents without double quotes.
                       </li>
                       <li>It is now possible to use overlapping leaderboard groups in an event, such that one
                           leaderboard can be part of more than one leaderboard group of the event. This comes in
                           handy if there are different schemes by which the regattas or leaderboards may be grouped
                           and is particularly useful for large events for filtering the regattas in the event
                           overview. Please note that in case a leaderboard is part of a leaderboard group with
                           an overall leaderboard ("series scoring"), the leaderboard group with the overall
                           leaderboard must be provided as the first of the overlapping leaderboard groups in
                           the scope of the event.
                       </li>
                       <li>Earlier releases have introduced an issue with leaderboard configuration and with binding
                           tracked races to their leaderboard slots. When a filter is set for the tracked races list,
                           changing the leaderboard selection or changing the race column selection such that the
                           tracked race for a selected race column is not visible due to the filter, the connection
                           between the race column and the tracked race is removed.<p>
                           In order to reduce chances for failure, now at least changing the leaderboard selection
                           will de-select any selected race column, making sure that nothing needs to be selected
                           in the potentially filtered list of tracked races.<p>
                           However, trouble remains: changing the tracked races filter while having a race column
                           with a tracked race connected selected in the table on the left will unlink the race
                           column's tracked race. As a workaround, you'll have to either de-select the race column
                           in the left table before changing the filter, e.g., by Ctrl-clicking the race column
                           selected. Or you remove any filter text for the tracked races list before you change
                           the selection in the race column table. This will make sure that the race connected
                           to the race column that you may select next will be available for automatic selection.

                        <li>We added user management. The /gwt/AdminConsole.html entry point for a fresh server set-up uses
                        admin/admin as username/password. You can change the password in the "Advanced &gt; User Management"
                        tab where also new users can be created. If you assign a use the role "admin" then the user will
                        be able to use the administration console. Stay tuned for a more sophisticated set of roles and
                        permissions to be added in the future.
                        </li>
                        <li>Reverse replication is now possible for selected events. When a replica instance receives a
                            modifying operation, such as a user logging in (creating a user session) or a wind fix being
                        entered through the Race Committee App, this change will be sent from the replica to the master
                        and from there be replicated to all other replicas attached.
                        </li>
                        <li>Starting a server with auto-replication enabled has been changed. The REPLICATE_ON_START environment
                            variable no longer is a Boolean value (True/False) but now has to list the replication services to be
                        replicated from the master. The default environments for replicas at

                        </li>
                        <li>The "Connectors" category has a new tab in the administration console, entitled "Regatta Structure Import".
                            If your regatta management system happens to be <a href="http://manage2sail.com">Manage2Sail</a> 
                        you can enter an event ID and show the list of regattas, then set defaults for how they shall be
                        created in the SAP Sailing Analytics. This allows you to import and create many regattas at once,
                        saving the laborious effort of manually creating them. Obviously, this can come in handy at large
                        events with regattas on many course areas in several different boat classes.

                    <ul class="bulletList">
                        <li>Replication has become much more robust and efficient. The initial load which used to be sent in a
                            single huge (although compressed) stream of data from the master to the replica(s) was hard to get
                            transmitted in the face of flaky and slow network connections. We've changed this: now the initial
                            load is transmitted as a sequence of messages using a message broker infrastructure. If a single
                            message doesn't arrive, it will be re-sent until it got through. The messages are buffered for several
                            minutes, so the initial load transmission can even survive and recover from severe network outages.<p>
                            
                            For the incremental replication process, we added compression, making the transmission more bandwidth-efficient
                            and therefore quicker and leaner. In addition, we've cleaned up the protocol a little, avoiding the
                            sending of redundant data, adding to the effects of compression. Replicating five live races with
                            approximately 40 to 50 competitors each, with four active wind measurement units each, requires approximately
                            30kB/s of network bandwidth between master and replica.
                        </li>
                        <li>Events now have lots of new attributes, particularly start/end date and multimedia content URLs</li>
                        
                        <li>Regattas can now be edited to <em>not</em> perform start time inference based on start mark passings.
                            Usually, when no start time is set by the race committee app or by the tracking provider or manually
                            through the administration console, the start time is inferred from the mark passings for the start
                            line. However, this can lead to unpleasant effects when the race committee aborts or postpones a race
                            and doesn't set a new start time for some period of time. When during this period one or more boats
                            cross the start line, a new start time would be inferred implicitly, showing scores in the leaderboard
                            and starting to compute all sorts of metrics. To avoid this, uncheck the checkbox
                            "Use start time inference from start mark passings" in the regatta create / edit dialog.</li>
                            
                        <li>When creating a regatta in the administration console, the regatta name is now taken from the create
                            dialog's "Name" field as-is and is no longer automatically extended by appending the boat class name
                            in parentheses to the base name. This is important to know if you so far have created several regattas
                            within the scope of the same event by simply providing the event name and the boat class name, relying
                            on the administration console to extend the regatta name by the boat class name because now with this
                            strategy your regattas would all be named the same. If you want to continue using some base name and
                            see the boat class name after the base name in parentheses you will now have to add that to the "Name"
                            field yourself, as in "Kieler Woche 2014 (470)". With this change, you can avoid having special
                            characters such as "/" in the regatta name which used to be a problem in particular for RESTful web services
                            that use the regatta name as a URL element. Boat classes such as "B/one" and "J/70" traditionally
                            had issues with this. Now, the regatta can simply be named "My Event (J70)" instead, and web service
                            access is hassle-free. The boat class can still be called "J/70" which can be useful if the result
                            management tool or the tracking partner spells it that way.</li>
