                    <ul class="bulletList">
                        <li>Allow entering a priority for courses managed in the AdminConsole.
                            The new default priority now is 1. It used to be 0 which caused problems
                            because the Race Manager app's highest (logically) priority is 1 which
                            never took priority over the AdminConsole-provided prio-0 events.</li>
                        <li>User sessions are now stored durably in the database so that they can be
                            restored in case of a server re-start. Users therefore will no longer need
                            to sign in again only because a server was re-started.</li>
                        <li>New availability checks have been implemented. Two new REST endpoints are provided:
                            <ul>
                              <li>/sailingserver/api/v1/status reports the availability of the "Sailing" application</li>
                              <li>/replication/replication?action=STATUS reports the availability of the replication module,
                                  providing details about each replication-capable component and queue lengths</li>
                              <li>the "status" script in the server's working directory, next to the "start" and "stop"
                                  script, now provides output based on the status checks above, plus a check for a 2XX
                                  response code for /index.html. The exit code for the "status" script is now 1 in case
                                  of an error / lack of availability, and 0 if all checks passed and server looks
                                  available.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2 class="articleSubheadline">October 2018</h2>
                    <ul class="bulletList">
                        <li>Added progress indicator to device mappings panel for smartphone tracking.</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h2 class="articleSubheadline">September 2018</h2>
                    <ul class="bulletList">
                        <li>Added automatic resizing when adding images to an event using the ImageDialog. 
                        It shows a check box if resizing is necessary, if you check it, the service will resize the image for you.</li>
                        <li>Now showing an error when trying to upload an image or video to an event and no working FileStorageService is registered.</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h2 class="articleSubheadline">August 2018</h2>
                    <ul class="bulletList">
                        <li>The mark passing editor now uses a full date/time format for the mark passing time points.</li>
                        <li>The TracTrac connector panel no longer shows a password visibly but uses a password text field.</li>
                        <li>The SwissTiming connector can now handle an "Update URL" together with username/password access
                            credentials which are used, if present, to send feedback requests about start times, race status
                            and course changes to that URL.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2 class="articleSubheadline">July 2018</h2>
                    <ul class="bulletList">
                        <li>When adding a YouTube video for tracked races ("Manage Media" in <tt>RaceBoard.html</tt> or "Tracked Races > Audio & Video" in <tt>AdminConsole.html</tt>) the respective video metadata is now read using YouTube API v3.
                            This functionality used to work some years ago using API v2 but was broken since this API version was discontinued some time ago.
                            Due to limitations of the new API we can't read the start timepoint of videos by now. You still need to provide this value manually.</li>
                        <li>In the "Tracked races" tab, within the eponymous section of the AdminConsole, the "Set start
                            time received" dialog can be used to remove the currently set start time received, by simply
                            leaving the value empty and confirming the dialog.</li>
                        <li>Up to 15 discards can now be configured for series and leaderboards. This enables, e.g., "Wednesday Night" scenarios
                            where over the season, say, 20 races are run but due to changing participation only, say, the five best ones shall be scored.</li>
                        <li>There is a new scoring scheme available to be selected upon regatta creation.
                            The scoring scheme is named "Low Point System, First with two wins in medals is winner" and introduces the following specifics compared to the standard low point scheme:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Medal series does not feature doubling of points in the medal series by default.</li>
                                <li>A competitor having two wins in the medal series is treated as overall winner.
                                    If there is a carry forward column in the medal series, having one point there also counts as a win which means the best competitor in the qualification needs a win less than any other finalist to be the overall winner.</li>
                                <li>If the medal series isn't started yet or no competitor has collected two wins, scoring by points is used.
                                    This also applies if the regatta is aborted (e.g. due to weather conditions) before any competitor could win two races in the medal series.</li>
                                <li>If two competitors have the same amount of points in the medal series the tie breaking criteria is the carry forward column of the medal series.
                                    If there is no carry forward column in the medal series, the last medal race is used as tie breaking criteria.
                                    For any non-medal series, the standard low point rules apply.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>A TracAPI upgrade from version 3.10.1 to 3.11.0 unifies the handling of course updates and solves an issue
                            observed with updating mark passing instructions.</li>
                        <li>Bug fix for mark position editor, now providing consistent behavior during adding of new mark fixes</li>
                        <li>Data Mining now more aggressively terminates running queries if needed.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2 class="articleSubheadline">June 2018</h2>
                    <ul class="bulletList">
                        <li>Added the available WindFinder Spot Collections. The desired ones can be selected from the WindFinder Tab in the Event Dialog.</li>
                        <li>Added the ability to change the url of multiple Mediatracks with a common prefix at once.
                            This is useful e.g. for video migration scenarios when movin videaos from one server to another.
                            This can be done from the adminconsole->tracked races->audio & videos tab</li>
                        <li>In raceboard when you edit a video you do not need to explicitly press "Preview" before saving anymore.
                            Saving now implicitly applies the changes.</li>
                        <li>The URLs of our GWT services are extended to include a leaderboard name if a call is context sensitive to a specific leaderboard.
                            This does not affect the functionality of any service but allows us to setup load balancing with leaderboard specific routing.
                            The leaderboard names put into the URL are cleaned: Any character that isn't a latin upper/lowercase letter or digit is replaced with an underscore character.
                            Currently, the following leaderboard specific URLs are used:
                            <ul>
                                <li>/gwt/service/sailing/leaderboard/[CLEANED-LEADERBOARD-NAME]</li>
                                <li>/gwt/service/dispatch/leaderboard/[CLEANED-LEADERBOARD-NAME]</li>
                            </ul>
                            Be aware that request without leaderboard suffix may be sent from pages that do not show leaderboard specific contents.
                            Due to this it is required to define a fallback rule for any unqualified request.
                            </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2 class="articleSubheadline">May 2018</h2>
                    <ul class="bulletList">
                        <li>Added the ability to add multiple mp4 videos as mediatracks at once via the new multi video dialog, located at trackedraces -> Audio & Video.
                            This features requires a webserver with index listing enabled. Additionally the dialog offers the ability to add the new mediatracks 
                            directly to all races overlapping the starttime and duration of the mediatrack.</li>
                        <li>On the "Edit mark positions" panel within RaceBoard, now a "Clear selection" button appears
                            when selecting a mark from the table, which provides an easier and more obvious way to
                            deselect all marks, what is needed in order to see the full course with all marks again.</li>
                        <li>The <tt>AutoPlay.html</tt> configuration "Sixty Inch" was improved for the usage with events that aren't part of an event series.
                            While no race is live or scheduled, only the overall leaderboard used to be shown.
                            In addition to this, also the regatta leaderboard is shown in an alternating order.
                            For non series events there is no overall leaderboard which means, that only the regatta leaderboard is shown.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2 class="articleSubheadline">April 2018</h2>
                    <ul class="bulletList">
                        <li>The import of additional expedition data was extended to read many additional measures.
                            These can be visualized in the leaderboard as well as the competitor charts in <tt>RaceBoard.html</tt>.
                            In addition, the leaderboard has been extended to provide bravo and expedition related measures consistently on race and leg level.
                            The respective settings dialogs were changed as well to only show specific options, if bravo or expedition tracks are available.
                            Any previously imported expedition tracks may be dropped and reimported to gain access to the newly introduced measures.</li>
                        <li>The settings dialog of the competitor charts in <tt>RaceBoard.html</tt> now provides the measures in alphabetical order (based on the current locale).
                            Expedition specific measures - if available - are shown at the end of the list.</li>
                        <li>The all in one expedition import has been extended to be able to import new competitor tracks or new races to an existing regatta.
                            Previously it was only possible to import a new event structure.</li>
                        <li>The Expedition log file import now prefers "GPS Time" for time stamping over "Utc" and over other date / time formats, making it
                            more consistent with the Expedition live connector which uses column 146 for time stamping which is GPS Time.</li>
                        <li>Two dimensional metrics can now be displayed by using a scatter plot presenter within the data mining tool.
                            Select a metric that returns a pair of numbers and choose "Average" or "Identity" as an aggregator.</li>
                        <li>Replication was made more robust for fixes that are delivered and applied asynchronously. If a race was removed
                            while still in tracking mode, fix-related operations may have been queued already on the replica when the
                            tracked race is removed. The pending GPS fix operations then would have clogged the executor threads until
                            the entire replica comes to a halt. With the change, race-related asynchronous operations will simply be
                            dropped when the race to which they pertain is not found on the replica.</li>
                        <li>When editing mark positions, all fixes are now displayed, including potential outliers.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2 class="articleSubheadline">March 2018</h2>
                    <ul class="bulletList">
                        <li>Boats are now separate entities. See the "Tracked Races / Boats" tab in the admin console.
                            When creating a regatta, you now need to specify whether in that regatta the competitors
                            may sail on changing boats ("Can boats of competitors change per race").
                            If boats can change, boat assignments need to be specified per
                            race. For the TracTrac connector this may happen as in the past, using the corresponding
                            metadata attributes (boatName, either one of boatId or boatUuid, and boatColor) on the
                            competitors in the race. For smartphone tracking, boats can be specified in the
                            "Connectors / Smartphone Tracking" tab by using the boat icon in the actions column of
                            the leaderboards table ("Boat Registrations"). This defines the boats from which you can
                            then select in the scope of each race of the regatta. When adding competitors to such
                            a race then you now have to assign boats from the boats list to each competitor before
                            you can confirm the competitor-to-race assignments.
                        </li>
                        <li>User, role and permission management has been extended. A new "tenant" concept
                            is now available. Users can belong to zero or more tenants and can have a default
                            tenant for a login session. Zero or more users can belong to a tenant. Objects have
                            a tenant owner and a user owner, similar to group and user ownerships of files in a
                            file system.<p>
                            By default, each user receives a default tenant that is named like the user, with "-tenant"
                            appended. This applies during user migration to this new version, as well as during
                            creation of new users. While a "default tenant" only specifies the tenant that objects
                            created by the user will have as their tenant owner, by default the user also "belongs"
                            to its default tenant (is part of that tenant's user group).<p>
                            Roles are now defined explicitly, in the "Roles" tab in the "Advanced" category.
                            A new server that is not sharing the security service with any other server will
                            start out with a few default role definitions, such as "admin" and "user". Roles imply permissions,
                            and the permissions they imply can be modeled in the "Roles" tab.<p>
                            Roles can be assigned to users in the UI-refurbished "User Management" tab in the
                            "Advanced" category. There is now a table with users that currently exist in the
                            system, with a pager and a filter box. Editing a user shows an edit dialog for that
                            user where roles and permissions can be added. Adding permissions works as usual.
                            However, when adding roles, qualifications for a tenant owner and a user owner
                            can be added using the following format for the role's name: &lt;rolename&gt;[:[&lt;tenantname&gt;][:[&lt;username&gt;]]].
                        </li>
                        <li>In addition to track competitors and marks using smartphone-tracking it is now possible to track boats.
                            This is e.g. useful for several national leagues where competitors are assigned dynamically to boats for each race.
                            In this case the competitors were used to bring a smartphone with them to the assigned boat.
                            With the recent changes regarding boat and competitor mapping per race, Smartphone-tracking is now enabled to dynamically track boat-mapped devices to the correct competitors in the context of a race.
                            There are two ways to add boats to be tracked to a regatta:
                            <ul>
                                <li>After adding a denotation to the racelog(s), add competitors to at least one race and ensure that the boats to be tracked are mapped to those</li>
                                <li>Register boats directly to the regatta</li>
                            </ul>
                            For available boats, you can now add mappings and generate a QR code in the corresponding dialog.
                            In addition, it is possible to upload tracking files and map them to boats.

                        <li>Further improvements of maneuver detection algorithm were introduced. Mark Passing is no longer regarded as a separate maneuver type. Instead, it is regarded as a supplementary information which gets appended to a maneuver instance. Therefore, a new filtering dimension was added for maneuver data mining, which is boolean and is named as "Mark Passing".</li>
                        <li>Added leaderboard group name as a dimension to a leaderboard's context</li>
                        <li>Added True Wind Angle as a data mining statistic on GPS fixes</li>

                            For example, a simple role name such as "admin" will give an unqualified role to the user.
                            To constrain the "admin" role to objects whose tenant owner is the tenant "abc", use
                            "admin:abc" for the role. To assign the role "admin" so that it applies only to objects
                            owner by user "u938" use "admin::u938".<p>
                            Tenants can be managed in the "Tenant Management" tab in the "Advanced" category. Here,
                            tenants can be created, removed and the set of users belonging to each tenant can be
                            edited.<p>
                            During migration of an existing server to this new version, a new default tenant will be
                            created using the server's name. All existing objects will by default have this new default
                            tenant as their tenant owner, and no user owner. All existing role assignments will be migrated
                            such that all roles will have as tenant qualification the new default tenant. This way,
                            users will maintain the rights they were assigned through roles only for those objects
                            belonging to the server's new default tenant (by default all objects on that server).
                            Only when new objects are created with a different tenant then the role's permissions
                            won't apply because the roles were by default constrained to the server's default tenant.
                            This will allow us to consolidate, merge and join the security services of various servers
                            at a later point in time, ensuring that users will not obtain permissions for objects they
                            are not eligible for.

                        Additionally, for mp4 videos it is now possible to use the start time, written in the file, as
                        a start time preset for the mediatrack, simplifying the video linking.</li>

                            For smart phone tracking it is possible to fill the pairing list into the race logs in order
                            to record the competitor / boat assignments according to the pairing list. To allow for
                            contiguous race numbering, in this context a new feature was introduced that allows users
                            to pick a race name prefix during denoting all races of a regatta for smart phone tracking,

                        <li>Authentication for Igtimi accounts is now possible with an OAuth process.
                            Instead of having to enter the username/password combination into the
                            administration console, a popup window will show an IFrame with Igtimi's
                            authentication form. Redirection goes to www.sapsailing.com, together with
                            a "state" URL parameter providing the base URL of the original server instance
                            requesting authentication. www.sapsailing.com will then redirect to that server,
                            removing the "state" parameter from the request and leaving only the "code"
                            parameter in the URL which the server ultimately receiving the redirected request
                            will use to obtain an access token and the Igtimi account details. For now, and
                            as a fallback, the old, non-OAuth process is still supported for a while, though
                            deprecated as of now.

                            request with a response code 302 (temporary redirect), but our TracTrac connector did
                            not handle this due to redirects that change protocols are not followed by default in
                            Java. This has now been changed, and although it is of course better to use the correct
                            protocol (HTTPS) right away, redirects will now be handled correctly, too.

                    <ul class="bulletList">
                        <li>The logic of the "Control tracking from start and finish times" check box now behaves slightly
                            differently. As before, a default start of tracking time is derived from the race start time
                            (currently five minutes before race start). Likewise, a default end of tracking time is derived
                            from the race finish time (the time when the blue flag was lowered, or more technically,
                            when a FINISHED race state was set in the race log) which is currently two minutes after
                            the race has finished. However, previously, when deviating start of tracking or end of tracking times
                            were set through other channels, such as received from TracTrac or set explicitly through
                            the administration console, new events would have been written to the race log, fixing the
                            start of tracking / end of tracking times according to the derivation rules.<p>
                            This logic has caused undesired effects and has therefore been removed. For example, when
                            an end of tracking time has been set explicitly through the administration console then
                            it may have been overwritten by a new end-of-tracking-time event appended to the race log
                            when the race is loaded again. Similarly, when a new start time was provided, an explicitly
                            set start of tracking time would have been canceled. With the new behavior, explicit settings
                            of start/end of tracking will remain untouched.<p>
                            For "Smartphone Tracking" the check box therefore now mainly controls whether or not a start/end
                            of tracking time is written to the race log when the user starts/stops tracking for the first time
                            through the administration console: when the tracking times are to be controlled by the race's
                            start and finish times, simply starting / stopping to track a race with the smartphone connector won't
                            set the start / end of tracking times.<p>
                            For the TracTrac connector, when the check box is set, as before messages will go out to TracTrac
                            when the race start / finish times have changed. The feedback from TracTrac will adjust the
                            tracking times as received by the connector, but no race log entries for the tracking times
                            will be created anymore.</li>
                        <li>A new type of leaderboard has been introduced: a regatta leaderboard with competitor elimination.
                            Such a leaderboard creates a view onto a regular regatta leaderboard and allows the user to
                            eliminate a subset of the competitors from its display. The scores of all remaining competitors
                            are taken from the original regatta leaderboard without modification, including all
                            corrections, penalties and the discarding rule, including the live ranks. This means,
                            in particular, that the ranks shown for a race in such a leaderboard are not contiguous in
                            case there are eliminated competitors. The score sum for each competitor is computed as usual.
                            For the regatta rank, a contiguous count is applied. This way it is possible to create
                            a new ranking for only a subset of the competitors; a practice common for championships
                            that want to publish a separate youth leaderboard, e.g., for all competitors under a

			 <li>Partial replication is now possible. If the system property <tt>replicate.on.start</tt>
			     that controls automatic replication upon start-up provides only a partial comma-separated
			     list of replicables, the connection to the master server (configured by the other
			     replication-related system properties such as <tt>replicate.master.servlet.host</tt> etc.)
			     will be used to replicate only those replicables whose IDs are specified in
			     <tt>replicate.on.start</tt>. All other replicables will operate locally.
			     Usually, the <tt>replicate.on.start</tt> system property is controlled
			     by the environment variable <tt>REPLICATE_ON_START</tt> that is set in the <tt>env.sh</tt>
			     configuration file used during server startup and influenced by the server environments
			     from <a href="http://releases.sapsailing.com/environments">http://releases.sapsailing.com/environments</a>
			     and overridden by the user details provided to the instance through the AWS EC2 machinery.<p>
			     The Administration Console (<tt>/gwt/AdminConsole.html</tt> entry point) will now
			     show which replicables a replica replicates, both, on the replica's administration
			     console's "Replication" panel, as well as on the master's "Replication" panel, there
			     for each replica.<p>
			     The master will restrict broadcasting its operations to those replicables for which
			     at least one replica has subscribed. While the initial load is requested individually
			     for each replica and can therefore be tailored to the replicas requested, the operation
			     broadcast channel is not specific to any replica. It therefore contains the operations
			     of all replicables for which at least one replica has subscribed. Replicas receiving
			     operations for replicables for which they did not subscribe will simply drop those
			     operations (note, however, that the replica will still have to read the operations from the
			     channel before dropping; this way, registering a replica may have bandwidth effects for
			     other replicas). Similarly, "backward replication" from a replica to a master will only
			     take place for those replicables for which the replica has requested replication from (and
			     therefore also "to") the master.<p>
			     With this it is now possible to replicate only the Security Service, using ID
			     <tt>com.sap.sse.security.impl.SecurityServiceImpl</tt>, running all other replicables
			     in "master mode." This will let the instance share user, permission, role and session management
			     details with the instance from which the Security Service is being replicated while
			     having its own master objects for all other replicables, such as the sailing application
			     (RacingEventService),  mail service or the polar data service. Note that with this feature
			     the server replicating another instance's Security Service will grant the roles and permissions
			     to subjects authenticated against that replicated Security Service. For example, if a user
			     has been granted the <tt>admin</tt> role by that service then the user has that role also
			     in all other server instances replicating that Security Service. Therefore, use this feature
			     with extreme caution. Keep in mind that in the near future we will extend the permissions and
			     role concept by the possibility to restrict permissions and roles to "scopes" such as an
			     event or a regatta or an account. See also
			     <a href="https://bugzilla.sapsailing.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=3504">https://bugzilla.sapsailing.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=3504</a>.

			 <li>The server can now optionally restore all races it had tracked the last time. This is
			     similar to a web browser's capability to restore the tabs the user had open when the browser
			     was terminated or crashed. To enable this feature, use the system property
			     <tt>restore.tracked.races</tt>, using the command line option <tt>-Drestore.tracked.races=true</tt>.
			     So far, the default for this system property is <tt>false</tt>, so by default, when the property
			     is not provided at all on the command line then the tracked races loaded last won't be restored,
			     and the server will start out with an empty set of tracked races.<p>
			     Note that the wind tracking properties, as set when initially tracking the race, are also restored
			     to their last state. If a live race has last been tracked with live wind tracking, with wind directions
			     being corrected by the local magnetic declination, then upon server restore the same live tracking will
			     be started again, including live wind tracking with the same declination correction settings.<p>
			     When the "Stop Tracking" feature is used, implicitly tracking wind will be stopped in case live wind
			     tracking had previously been requested for that race. This change is also considered during the restore
			     process where such a race will no longer receive live wind tracking upon restoring it.<p>
			     When a tracked race is removed from the server then it will not be restored anymore upon the next
			     server restart with the restore option enabled. When an entire regatta with a number of tracked
			     races linked into it is removed then the tracked races are removed as well and will not be
			     restored upon server re-start.<p>
			     The restore progress can be monitored using the JConsole or any other JMX monitoring tool. In the
			     <tt>com.sap.sailing</tt> category you will find the <tt>RacingEventService</tt> object. Among its
			     attributes there are now the two new ones: <tt>NumberOfTrackedRacesToRestore</tt> and

			<li>When denoting a regatta for smartphone tracking, the "By Marks" course designer is
			    automatically selected if no active regatta configuration was set yet, or a warning
			    and question to the user is issued, strongly suggesting the use of the "By Marks" course
			    designer. Background: using the "By Name" course designer could accidentally delete a
			    valid course layout.
			</li>
			<li>Regattas now have an additional setting: "Control tracking from start and finish times."
			    With it, the start and finish times for a race as entered into the race log, e.g., through
			    the Race Management app, can be used by tracking connectors to control the tracking for
			    that race. So far, the TracTrac connector and the Smartphone connector have been
			    enabled. When a start time for a race
			    is received and the "Control..." flag is set, the tracking start time will be set to
			    five minutes before the race start time. Similarly, when the blue flag is lowered, signaling
			    that the race has finished, the tracking end time will be set to two minutes later.
			    This should make an operator's job easier when the race timing is maintained properly
			    through the race log, i.e., through the Race Management app.<p>
			    In turn, for the Smartphone tracking connector, start/end tracking times are recorded
			    automatically upon start and stop tracking actions only if the regatta is <em>not</em>
			    marked as "Control tracking from start and finish times." Background: with this it is
			    possible to start tracking for a number of races scheduled for a day and having the
			    Race Management app control the tracking times automatically.

			 <li>The "start of tracking" property on a tracked race now has to be set to a valid, non-empty value

			 <li>The device mappings dialog now shows the time point of the last fix received from each mapping

			     are now created, and thread priorities less than normal (for background operations) now

                            via smartphone apps or uploading tracking files can also be used in combination with

			    scheme for only a subset of the competitor.

			<li>When entering a fixed position for a mark in the "Smartphone Tracking" environment it is

			<li>A series within a regatta can now define a maximum number of discards applied in that
			    series. When combined with leaderboard-wide discards, generally discards can be distributed
			    across the leaderboard as needed, but restricted by the maximum specified for each series.
			    Leave the maximum empty to not provide any maximum. Setting to 0 will cause no scores to
			    be discarded in that series.

			<li>An event now has a "Base URL" which should be used to enable useful e-mail notifications with

			<li>Some REST APIs have slightly changed. The /api/v1/leaderboards/{name} resource now
			    has the "netPoints" and "totalPoints" stuff right. The "netPoints" always refer to
			    scores which may be reduced due to discarding rules. Total points always refer to
			    the points before applying any discarding rules. Those numeric values for which so far
			    accidentally String types with double-quoted values were used have been changed to
			    numeric types, represented in the JSON documents without double quotes.
			</li>
			<li>It is now possible to use overlapping leaderboard groups in an event, such that one
			    leaderboard can be part of more than one leaderboard group of the event. This comes in
			    handy if there are different schemes by which the regattas or leaderboards may be grouped
			    and is particularly useful for large events for filtering the regattas in the event
			    overview. Please note that in case a leaderboard is part of a leaderboard group with
			    an overall leaderboard ("series scoring"), the leaderboard group with the overall
			    leaderboard must be provided as the first of the overlapping leaderboard groups in
			    the scope of the event.
			</li>
			<li>Earlier releases have introduced an issue with leaderboard configuration and with binding
			    tracked races to their leaderboard slots. When a filter is set for the tracked races list,
			    changing the leaderboard selection or changing the race column selection such that the
			    tracked race for a selected race column is not visible due to the filter, the connection
			    between the race column and the tracked race is removed.<p>
			    In order to reduce chances for failure, now at least changing the leaderboard selection
			    will de-select any selected race column, making sure that nothing needs to be selected
			    in the potentially filtered list of tracked races.<p>
			    However, trouble remains: changing the tracked races filter while having a race column
			    with a tracked race connected selected in the table on the left will unlink the race
			    column's tracked race. As a workaround, you'll have to either de-select the race column
			    in the left table before changing the filter, e.g., by Ctrl-clicking the race column
			    selected. Or you remove any filter text for the tracked races list before you change
			    the selection in the race column table. This will make sure that the race connected
			    to the race column that you may select next will be available for automatic selection.

						and from there be replicated to all other replicas attached.

					    <li>Starting a server with auto-replication enabled has been changed. The REPLICATE_ON_START environment

					<h2 class="articleSubheadline">July 2014</h2>
					<ul class="bulletList">
					    <li>Replication has become much more robust and efficient. The initial load which used to be sent in a
					        single huge (although compressed) stream of data from the master to the replica(s) was hard to get
					        transmitted in the face of flaky and slow network connections. We've changed this: now the initial
					        load is transmitted as a sequence of messages using a message broker infrastructure. If a single
					        message doesn't arrive, it will be re-sent until it got through. The messages are buffered for several
					        minutes, so the initial load transmission can even survive and recover from severe network outages.<p>
					        
					        For the incremental replication process, we added compression, making the transmission more bandwidth-efficient
					        and therefore quicker and leaner. In addition, we've cleaned up the protocol a little, avoiding the
					        sending of redundant data, adding to the effects of compression. Replicating five live races with
					        approximately 40 to 50 competitors each, with four active wind measurement units each, requires approximately
					        30kB/s of network bandwidth between master and replica.
					    </li>
					    <li>Events now have lots of new attributes, particularly start/end date and multimedia content URLs</li>
					    
						<li>Regattas can now be edited to <em>not</em> perform start time inference based on start mark passings.
						    Usually, when no start time is set by the race committee app or by the tracking provider or manually
						    through the administration console, the start time is inferred from the mark passings for the start
						    line. However, this can lead to unpleasant effects when the race committee aborts or postpones a race
						    and doesn't set a new start time for some period of time. When during this period one or more boats
						    cross the start line, a new start time would be inferred implicitly, showing scores in the leaderboard
						    and starting to compute all sorts of metrics. To avoid this, uncheck the checkbox
						    "Use start time inference from start mark passings" in the regatta create / edit dialog.</li>
						    
						<li>When creating a regatta in the administration console, the regatta name is now taken from the create
						    dialog's "Name" field as-is and is no longer automatically extended by appending the boat class name
						    in parentheses to the base name. This is important to know if you so far have created several regattas
						    within the scope of the same event by simply providing the event name and the boat class name, relying
						    on the administration console to extend the regatta name by the boat class name because now with this
						    strategy your regattas would all be named the same. If you want to continue using some base name and
						    see the boat class name after the base name in parentheses you will now have to add that to the "Name"
						    field yourself, as in "Kieler Woche 2014 (470)". With this change, you can avoid having special
						    characters such as "/" in the regatta name which used to be a problem in particular for RESTful web services
						    that use the regatta name as a URL element. Boat classes such as "B/one" and "J/70" traditionally
						    had issues with this. Now, the regatta can simply be named "My Event (J70)" instead, and web service
						    access is hassle-free. The boat class can still be called "J/70" which can be useful if the result
						    management tool or the tracking partner spells it that way.</li>
