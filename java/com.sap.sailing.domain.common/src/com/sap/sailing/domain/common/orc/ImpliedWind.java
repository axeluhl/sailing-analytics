/**
 * Provides information about the so-called "implied wind" of a race that is ranked by ORC Performance Curve Scoring
 * (PCS). Implied wind is generally determined by mapping a competitor's elapsed time "backwards" through the
 * performance curve function to obtain a wind speed at which the time allowance for the course sailed matches
 * with the time elapsed. In uses of ORC PCS scoring before 2015 this was the ranking criterion, whereas since 2015
 * the general rule is to take the maximum implied wind achieved by any competitor and use it to determine each
 * competitor's time allowance for the course sailed, then comparing their elapsed time to their allowance and
 * using the difference as the ranking criterion.<p>
 * 
 * In some cases it does not have to be the maximum implied wind of a race that is used to compute the time
 * allowances, but it could be another race's maximum implied wind, or it could be a fixed speed decided by
 * a race officer based on observations or gut feel.<p>
 * 
 * An instance of a class implementing this interface will tell the <em>effective</em> implied wind used for
 * scoring purposes, and it will explain where this implied wind value came from, namely either by observing
 * the corresponding race's maximum implied wind, or by fetching it from another race (which transitively could
 * again fetch it from somewhere else, and so on), or by explicitly fixing it at a constant value.<p>
 * 
 * This object is considered immutable and a snapshot taken from a race at {@link #getTimePoint a time point}.
