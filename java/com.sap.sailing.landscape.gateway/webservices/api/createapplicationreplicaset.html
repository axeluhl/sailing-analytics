<h1>SAP Sailing Analytics Webservices API Version 1.0</h1>
<h2>URL: /sailinglandscape/api/landscape/createapplicationreplicaset</h2>

<b>Description:</b>
 <p>Creates an application replica set with an auto-scaling group and corresponding launch template, load
 balancer rules and corresponding target groups, hooking up to the region's default MongoDB replica set and
 RabbitMQ and replicating the security service and shared sailing data from the security-service.sapsailing.com
 server by default.</p>

            <div><tt>sharedMasterInstance</tt> defaults to <tt>false</tt>; if set to <tt>true</tt>, the instance launched for the master process
                                     will be named "SL Multi-Server" and will be tagged with <tt>sailing-analytics-server:___multi___</tt> which
                                     makes it eligible for automated deployment of other Sailing Analytics processes, such as unmanaged replicas.
                                     Otherwise, the master instance will be named and tagged after the replica set's name.</div>
            <div><tt>sharedInstanceType</tt>, instance type to use in the hyperscaler for a new shared master instance (if <tt>sharedMasterInstance</tt> was
                                     set to <tt>true</tt>) as well as for a new instance that needs to be launched for a shared first replica
                                     in case <tt>minimumAutoScalingGroupSize</tt> is set to 0; e.g., I3_2_XLARGE;
                                     see <a href="https://sdk.amazonaws.com/java/api/latest/software/amazon/awssdk/services/ec2/model/InstanceType.html">here</a>.
                                     If you'd like to configure your master to run on an instance intended to be shared with other
                                     replica sets you may want to size your shared instance type with much swap space (e.g., i3.2xlarge)
                                     whereas your auto scaling group-managed replicas will not be shared and hence may get along with smaller
                                     instance types.</div>.
            <div><tt>dynamicLoadBalancerMappingionId</tt>, boolean value (false or true; defaulting to false); if true, the rules will be entered
                                                  into the region's default dynamic load balancer without a specific DNS mapping. In this
                                                  case the domain must not be specified or must be "sapsailing.com", and the region must
                                                  be the default region (eu-west-1), or an error status will result.</div>
            <div><tt>releaseName</tt>, the release name, such as build-202108091125; if not provided, the latest master build is used by default.</div>
            <div><tt>masterReplicationBearerToken</tt>, the bearer token the new replica set's master will use to replicate the security service and
                                               shared sailing data from the central security-service.sapsailing.com server; defaults to the
                                               bearer token of the user authenticated for this request. Note that this requires the
                                               server processing this request to share the security information from security-service.sapsailing.com, too.</div>
            <div><tt>replicaReplicationBearerToken</tt>, the bearer token the new replica set's replicas will use to replicate their master server; defaults to the
                                               bearer token of the user authenticated for this request. Note that this requires the
                                               server processing this request to share the security information from security-service.sapsailing.com, too.</div>
            <div><tt>domainName</tt>, the domain name to use for the DNS entry that points to the load balancer holding the rules for the new replica set.
                             Defaults to sapsailing.com. If dynamic load balancing is used, this parameter must either not be provided or must
                             use the default domain sapsailing.com.</div>
            <div><tt>memoryInMegabytes</tt>, can be used to specify the absolute amount of heap size used for the Java VM running the applications, both, on master
                                    and replicas; if not specified, memoryTotalSizeFactor may be used (see below); if that isn't used either, heap size
                                    is computed based on the amount of memory available on the instance, not considering any swap space available.</div>
            <div><tt>memoryTotalSizeFactor</tt>, can be used if memoryInMegabytes is not used; it roughly specifies how many processes are intended to be run on the
                                        host; e.g., if 4 is specified, approximately 1/4 of the physical memory available (not considering swap space) is
                                        assigned as the process's heap space. If neither memoryInMegabytes nor memoryTotalSizeFactor are specified then
                                        the amount of memory is calculated automatically based on the amount of physical memory available on the host.</div>
            <div><tt>minimumAutoScalingGroupSize</tt>, defines how many replicas the auto-scaling group shall minimally keep running, even if the auto-scaling
                                        rules things that less may be enough. Defaults to 1. If 0, an "unmanaged" replica will be launched on a shared instance
                                        for availability reasons. The shared instance is picked such that it has the HTTP port required for the new replica set
                                        free and that it runs in an availability zone different from where the master process was just deployed. If required,
                                        a new instance will be launched for this purpose. Other than for the auto-scaling group-managed replica instances
                                        the instance for an unmanaged replica is assumed to be for sharing, and hence it's instance type is set to be the
                                        same as for the instance hosting the master process. This way, if the master instance type is selected such that
                                        it works well for being shared then so will the instance that needs to be launched for an unmanaged replica.</div>
            <div><tt>maximumAutoScalingGroupSize</tt>, defines how many replicas the auto-scaling group shall create at most. Defaults to 30.</div>
