OSGI-ified version of AWS Java SDK from http://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.apache.servicemix.bundles/org.apache.servicemix.bundles.aws-java-sdk
Due to bug (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SMX4-1921): add awssdk_config_default.json (obtained from original AWS Java SDK) to downloaded jar.
Note: with bug 3683 we're upgrading to version 1.10.17_1 of the org.apache.servicemix.bundles.aws-java-sdk component. It has an entry

	5004 Fri Apr 29 18:48:10 CEST 2016 com/amazonaws/internal/config/awssdk_config_default.json
	
and hence suggests that the patch described above as necessary for version 1.9.8_1 may no longer be necessary.
