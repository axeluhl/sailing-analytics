/**
 * Encapsulates the serialization (using an {@link ObjectOutputStream}) and the buffering with delayed sending for a
 * sequence of {@link Operation}s. For sending, a {@link Pair} of {@code byte[]} and {@code List<Class<?>>} is
 * {@link Deque#add(Object) added} to the {@link Deque} passed to the constructor. This assumes that a thread is trying
 * to {@link BlockingQueue#take() take} elements from that queue to send them out one by one to the replicas, logging
 * the metrics about the types of objects being sent this way.
 * <p>
 * 
 * Buffering is limited by two factors: maximum message size and maximum buffering duration. Limiting the message size
 * avoids clogging the heap with buffered messages and respects the underlying messaging framework's maximum message
 * size. Limiting the buffering duration even in the face of a continuous stream of incoming operations helps keeping
 * the replication delay below some threshold.
 * <p>
 * 
 * Besides the {@link Deque} to which to send complete messages, two other important objects form the core of the state
 * of this serializing buffer:
 * <ul>
 * <li>An {@link ObjectOutputStream} constructed freshly for each binary message assembled; it can serialize multiple
 * operations which has the benefit of reducing the metadata overhead (type information) that needs to be written to the
 * stream and of increasing sharing potential for common strings.</li>
 * <li>A {@link ByteArrayOutputStream} into which the {@link ObjectOutputStream} serializes the {@link Operation}s and
 * whose contents will be sent as the {@code byte[]} to the {@link Deque} passed to the constructor.</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * Time-limiting the buffering process is supported by a {@link Timer} passed to the constructor, and a
 * {@link TimerTask} constructed by an instance of this class once the first operation has been serialized to a new
 * buffer. The {@link TimerTask} is scheduled to run after the replication buffering delay, passed as a configuration
 * parameter to the constructor, too.
 * <p>
 * 
 * This serializing buffer is thread-safe. Threads can write operations to it at any time after object construction has
 * finished. The implementation takes care of synchronizing those writes and the subsequent object serialization to the
 * {@code byte[]} buffer with each other and with sending and clearing the buffer. Objects of this class can be
 * "recycled" through any number of message sends; "sending" another message by adding it to the {@link Deque} passed to
 * the constructor will empty the buffer; the next operation written to this buffer will create a new
 * {@link ObjectOutputStream} and {@code byte[]} buffer.
 * <p>
 * 
 * Use multiple instances of this class in conjunction with a thread pool to send out operations that allow for
 * {@link Operation#requiresSynchronousExecution() asynchronous execution} on the replica side. For these operations the
 * rather expensive object serialization may run in parallel, thus increasing replication throughput which in typical
 * configurations is limited by the single-threaded {@link ObjectOutputStream} and compression throughput and not so
 * much by the bandwidth offered by the messaging infrastructure. One instance should be reserved for operations that
 * {@link Operation#requiresSynchronousExecution() require synchronous execution}. Those need to be applied in the order
 * in which they were received by the {@link ReplicationService}. The number of additional such buffers should be
 * determined by the typical thread pool size (e.g., equaling the number of CPUs available to the VM). Operations
 * allowing for asynchronous execution can then be serialized truly in parallel, and their serialization may even happen
 * outside the thread requesting their broadcast. This can accelerate, e.g., the loading process of tracking data on the
 * master because the loading process no longer has to wait for the serialization to finish but may enqueue the
 * operations for serialization.
 * <p>
 * 
 * <em>Implementation Quirk:</em> When a buffer is sent because it reached the maximum message size, the
 * {@link TimerTask} scheduled will still fire at some later point; this will lead to a sending delay that can be
 * shorter than the timeout configured.
 * <p>
 * 
 * Invariants when outside of a {@code synchronized} block using this object's monitor:
 * <ul>
 * <li>If and only if there is a valid {@link #objectOutputStream} to which the next operation can be written, the
 * {@link #replicableIdAsString} is properly set.</li>
 * <li>The {@link #objectOutputStream}, the {@link #listOfClasses} and the {@link #bos} byte-array output stream hold
 * equivalent content; objects serialized through the output output stream are serialized to the byte-array output
 * stream</li>
 * <li>When there is at least one operation serialized in the streams, a {@link #timerTask} is scheduled with the
 * {@link #timer} which will guarantee sending the buffer after the {@link #timeout} has expired since writing the first
 * operation to the streams.</li>
 * </ul>
