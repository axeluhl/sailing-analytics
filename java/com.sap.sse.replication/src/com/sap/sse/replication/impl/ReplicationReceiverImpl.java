     * The handling of those queues for asynchronous operations makes sure that a task processing the queue is scheduled
     * with the executor or already running if and only if there are operations in the queue. When the task removes the
     * last operation from the queue, the queue is removed and the task decides to finish. From this point on, if another
     * asynchronous operation with that same key arrives, a new queue and subsequently a new task will be created, and the
     * task will be scheduled with the executor. These steps are performed under the necessary synchronization so that
     * no race conditions can occur (such as the task deciding to finish, yet another operation getting added to the queue
     * which hence gets dropped because then the queue would be deleted; or similar "desasters").
