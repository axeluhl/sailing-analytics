The former "p2admin" target definition is not tracked in the repository anymore.
Instead, it can be generated from the existing target definition via ``../scripts/createLocalTargetDef.sh``.
This script copies the existing target definition and replaces the remote URL ``https://p2.sapsailing.com/p2/sailing/`` with a local ``file://`` URL.
