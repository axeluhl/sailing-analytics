/**
 * An operational transformation {@link Operation} is expected to return the target state after applying the operation.
 * This operation type offers the possibility to let an operation return a result value from its
 * {@link #internalApplyTo} method while in the context of operational transformation the operation will still return
 * the target state.<p>
 * 
 * Operations that are instance of a class implementing this interface inherit the serializability declared by this
 * interface. Multiple operation instances may be serialized into the same {@link ObjectOutputStream} (see also
 * bug 5741). Keep this in mind when choosing how to represent the operation's internals. For example, it is not a
 * good idea to have the operation reference a mutable object with the intention to transport a new "to-be" state
 * this way. If multiple such state changes end up in the same stream of operations, the mutable object will be
 * serialized to the stream only once, in one (probably the first, thus oldest) state, and all subsequent operations
 * referencing that same object will serialize only a handle referencing the object state already written. With this,
 * you may lose state changes. Hence, make sure to either clone such objects before storing the clone in the operation,
 * or---even better---use specialized operations describing the specific state change to apply. For example, instead
 * of serializing an object with all its attributes, rather implement an operation per attribute that updates only
 * that attribute's value. It may be more tedious, but it keeps your serialized operations small, is therefore more
 * bandwidth-efficient in the replication architecture and less prone to accidentally dropping state changes by
 * representing the same object in the stream only once.
