/**
 * A track records {@link Timed} items for an object of type <code>ItemType</code>. It allows clients to ask for a value
 * close to a given {@link TimePoint}. The track manages a time-based set of raw fixes. An implementation may have an
 * understanding of how to eliminate outliers. For example, if a track implementation knows it's tracking boats, it may
 * consider fixes that the boat cannot possibly have reached due to its speed and direction change limitations as
 * outliers. The set of fixes with outliers filtered out can be obtained using {@link #getFixes} whereas
 * {@link #getRawFixes()} returns the unfiltered, raw fixes. If an implementation has no idea what an outlier is,
 * both methods will return the same fix sequence.<p>
 * 
 * With tracks, concurrency is an important issue. Threads may want to modify a track while other threads may want to
 * read from it. Several methods such as {@link #getLastFixAtOrBefore(TimePoint)} return a single fix and can manage
 * concurrency internally. However, those methods returning a collection of fixes, such as {@link #getFixes()} or an
 * iterator over a collection of fixes, such as {@link #getFixesIterator(TimePoint, boolean)}, need special treatment.
 * Until we internalize such iterations (see bug 824, http://bugzilla.sapsailing.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=824),
 * callers need to manage a read lock which is part of a {@link ReadWriteLock} managed by this track. Callers do so
 * by calling {@link #lockForRead} and {@link #unlockAfterRead}.
