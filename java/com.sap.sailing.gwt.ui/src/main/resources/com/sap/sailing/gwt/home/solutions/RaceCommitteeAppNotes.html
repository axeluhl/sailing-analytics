		<h5 class="articleSubheadline">July 2016</h5>

		<ul	class="bulletList">
			<li>Finishing races in the TimePanel show the race duration of the "first ship home."</li>
		</ul>

		<h5 class="articleSubheadline">June 2016</h5>

		<ul class="bulletList">
			<li>The start time editing screen has now a "Sync to minute" button, which replaces
			    the both buttons beside the countdown. This button sets the countdown to the nearest
			    minute and after "Set time" the new start time will be sent to the server.</li>
			<li>The "Set Time" button in the start time editing screen remains disabled now until
			    the user actually makes a change. This also helps to identify that "Set Time"
			    needs to be tapped in order to transmit a change carried out using the
			    "Sync to minute" button.</li>
			<li>Changing the server, signing out, changing hidden event visibility,
			    and changing the regatta now properly ensures that the
			    content is refreshed based on the new settings.</li>
		</ul>

		<h5 class="articleSubheadline">May 2016</h5>

		<ul class="bulletList">
			<li>A bug related to entering the passing instructions for a waypoint in the "by-marks"
			    course designer has been fixed. At the same time, for now the passing instructions
			    "Offset" and "Fixed Bearing" are no longer offered until the application really offers
			    support for them, particularly during mark passing calculation.</li>
			<li>Swiping the start time button to the left to reach the other buttons for entering
			    the racing procedure, start mode flag, etc. now works reliably, also in case
			    of multi-touch which may have made the app crash before.</li>
			<li>Regatta-specific preferences now properly take precedence over the device configuration.
			    They are updated from the server when the regatta content is refreshed.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h5 class="articleSubheadline">April 2016</h5>

		<ul class="bulletList">
			<li>Whether or not result entry during or after the finishing phase is offered is now
			    a preference under "REGATTA CONFIGURATION (DEFAULT)." The device configuration managed
			    on the server can remotely manage this configuration setting. With this, it is possible
			    to configure up-front whether a race officer is offered the possibility to manage
			    results directly from the Race Manager app. This should <em>not</em> be used if an
			    external, official regatta management system is being used to capture and manage
			    the official scores.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h5 class="articleSubheadline">March 2016</h5>

		<ul class="bulletList">
			<li>Added sign in/sign out into the app. The user has to be create in the backend, with leaderboard
				permission. Without the permission, the user can't send data to the server.</li>
			<li>We changed the QR Code, so it includes the user's access token. There is also a possibility to manual login into
				the app, if no QR Code is available. <b>The app doesn't store username and password.</b></li>
			<li>The behavior of the red share icon has also slightly changed. If it is red and tapped, it will call the server
				to check, if the users access token is still valid. If not the server response with a 401 error code and the user
				has to enter his credentials.</li>
			<li>You can force a user sign out within the overflow menu, if you need other user credentials.</li>
		</ul>

		<h5 class="articleSubheadline">February 2016</h5>

		<ul class="bulletList">
			<li>Added responsive design. You can now use the app on every tablet as well as on <b>mobile phones</b>.</li>
			<li>We returned the group races switch to ESS races. It's located in the left panel bar (or top on phones).</li>
			<li>The behavior of ESS course designer is compact in two lists. The marks and rounding can be easily changed by tapping on it.</li>
		</ul>

		<h5 class="articleSubheadline">August 2015</h5>

		<ul class="bulletList">
		    <li>Fixes for Android Lollipop were deployed. They solve font size and other display issues.
		    </li>
		    <li>The true wind direction provided during wind entry in the app is now interpreted to be a
		        direction based on magnetic north, not true north. This is common practice as wind readings
		        are typically produced on a start vessel based on a magnetic compass device.
		    </li>
		</ul>

		<h5 class="articleSubheadline">July 2015</h5>

		<ul class="bulletList">
		    <li>Added support for dependent start times. Races can set their start time relative
		    	to another race's start time. Caveat: Currently, when aborting races on which other
		    	races depend, requires either aborting the dependent races before or setting an
		    	absolute start time on the dependent races.
		    </li>
		</ul>

		<h5 class="articleSubheadline">June 2015</h5>

		<ul class="bulletList">
		    <li>Major overhaul of the entire race committee app. The app has a completely new user interface
		        with a light and a dark theme. The functionality generally remained unchanged.
		    </li>
		</ul>

		<h5 class="articleSubheadline">July 2014</h5>
		<ul class="bulletList">
			<li>The race list is now ordered by fleets. This means we display the same order of our backend system in the RCApp.
			Now the race officials can easily use the order which is displayed and do not have to care about the fleet color order.</li>
		</ul>

		<h5 class="articleSubheadline">March 2014</h5>
		<ul class="bulletList">
			<li>Moved away from using a label to create a course and introduced a big button that
			eases the input of courses.</li>
			
			<li>Added a new countdown button for ESS and RRS26 start configurations. Using this
			button one can easily set the start time of a race to exactly the time the countdown starts.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h5 class="articleSubheadline">January 2014</h5>
		<ul class="bulletList">
			<li>Server-based device configuration</li>

			<li>Device initialization with QR codes</li>

			<li>Automatic upgrades and downgrades to match server software version</li>

			<li>Multiple devices can work on the same race (e.g., start vessel, finishing vessel, shore control)</li>
