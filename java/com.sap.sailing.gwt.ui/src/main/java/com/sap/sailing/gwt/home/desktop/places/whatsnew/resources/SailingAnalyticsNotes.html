         <ul class="bulletList">
           <li>Fixed an issue with the plans shown as subscribed to based on the plan
               categories. For premium users it would have seemed they implicitly got
               a data mining plan although they did not. Please note that currently
               you still require to get in touch (support@sapsailing.com) in order
               to upgrade from a Premium to a data mining plan. This is a known
               issue that we are working on currently.</li>
         </ul>
         <h5 class="articleSubheadline">May 2023</h5>
         <ul class="bulletList">
            <li>An STP or SCP scoring code ("Standard Penalty" / "Scoring Penalty") now by default adds 1.0 to the competitor's score as calculated based on the ranking.
                The STP / SCP code is shown already with the beginning of the race, but any official scoring result entered after the race will be
                used during replay only once the competitor has finished the race. For the medal stages of the new Formula Kite scoring
                (Low Point, First to Win Three Races, both, the A8.1 and A8.2 variants) an STP / SCP will add 1.1 to the competitor's score.</li>
            <li>The "Low Point, First to Win Three Races" scoring schemes, which rank competitors in the medal series based on the number of
                "races won" now count a win if the competitor has achieved the lowest score in that race. This changes the previous rule where
                the competitor needed to score 1.0 points in order to be called the "winner" of that race. In particular, with this change
                a competitor with, say, 2.0 points can be the "winner" of the race in case the competitor finishing first took a standard
                penalty (STP) or scoring penalty (SCP) which adds 1.1 points to the 1.0 point awarded for finishing first, so a total of 2.1 points, thus worse
                than the 2.0 points of the competitor finishing second. Should there still be a tie on points, the finishing order is
                used to break that tie.</li>
            <li>Average leg Velocity Made Good (VMG) is now available in <a href="/gwt/DataMining.html">data mining</a>.</li>
         </ul>
         <h5 class="articleSubheadline">April 2023</h5>
         <ul class="bulletList">
           <li>Added XTE (cross-track error) to data mining statistics on GPS fixes</li>
         </ul>
         <h5 class="articleSubheadline">March 2023</h5>
         <ul class="bulletList">
           <li>Added VMG to data mining statistics on GPS fixes</li>
         </ul>
         <h5 class="articleSubheadline">February 2023</h5>
         <ul class="bulletList">
           <li>Added ability to upload multiple gallery media files of an event at once. It also includes some optimizations and bug fixes.</li>
           <li>The <a href="/gwt/DataMining.html">Data Mining module</a> now supports combining several queries
               displayed in the well-known multi-tab view at the bottom into a "report" that can also have
               "parameters." For example, you can bind the regatta selection of the various queries you run
               to a single "Regatta" parameter by using the new "P" button. This will synchronize your
               filter selection across those queries. Like queries, reports can be saved and loaded using a
               report name. The parameter settings are stored together with the report. If after loading
               you change, e.g., the regatta selection that was bound to a parameter, the selection changes
               for all your queries in the report. Running them again after switching to their results tab
               will get you the synchronized results.</li>
           <li>Bug fix: sometimes, when removing a dimension from the grouping instructions in DataMining,
               remnants of the previous grouping structure could have remained when running the new query
               with fewer dimensions. Deferring the chart update to outside the current event loop has
               solved this issue.</li>
           <li>Data mining now offers administrators with the necessary permissions to analyze role, permission,
               session and subscription data for administrative purposes.</li>
           <li>The <tt>.../v2/leaderboards</tt> API now supports the <tt>LEG_AVERAGE_SPEED_OVER_GROUND_IN_KNOTS</tt> detail type,
               also included when specifying <tt>ALL</tt>. It produces the field <tt>currentLegAverageSpeedOverGround-kts</tt>
               in the <tt>data</tt> part of the result document.</li>
         </ul>
         <h5 class="articleSubheadline">January 2023</h5>
         <ul class="bulletList">
           <li>Allow dragging the time slider, scrubbing the time line, on touch devices.</li>
         </ul>
         <h5 class="articleSubheadline">December 2022</h5>
         <ul class="bulletList">
           <li>Added Czech language support</li>
         </ul>
         <h5 class="articleSubheadline">November 2022</h5>
         <ul class="bulletList">
           <li>Added flag and country code for South Sudan.</li>
           <li>Fixed bug in data mining module: elements from section "Race Results" (Absolute Rank,
               Number of Podium Finishes, Number of Wins, and Relative Score (0 best; 1 worst))
               have erroneously been "multiplied" by the race columns in the leaderboard. For example,
               when summing up wins in a regatta with four races, the results were a factor of four
               too great.</li>
         </ul>
         <h5 class="articleSubheadline">October 2022</h5>
         <ul class="bulletList">
           <li>The Race Map now has a "wind ladder" that can be activated through the map settings.
               It displays a transparent texture on top of the map that is oriented perpendicularly
               to the current leg's wind direction, parallel to the advantage line. It moves with
               the leading boat. It scales such that one spoke is a power of ten meters (10m, 100m, 1000m, ...).
               When panning and zooming you may notice a slight jitter, depending on your browser and
               platform; nothing to worry about ;-). The feature is still experimental and will be improved
               over the next few weeks. Among other things we are aware of the long loading time and
               a sometimes unproportional scaling of light and dark areas of the ladder. Furthermore, the
               ladder only appears / disappears according to changes in the settings when the time point
               is changed, e.g., in playing state.</li>
         </ul>
         <h5 class="articleSubheadline">July 2022</h5>
         <ul class="bulletList">
           <li>Paypal is now available as payment method for subscriptions.</li>
         </ul>
         <h5 class="articleSubheadline">June 2022</h5>
         <ul class="bulletList">
           <li>Bug fix: in the REST API's leaderboard-related end points the leaderboard object was not properly
               used for premium permission checks. Therefore, a premium role qualified, e.g., with a user group
               did not properly grant its permissions to requests.</li>
           <li>Fixed a regression regarding the availability of <tt>/sailingserver/api/v1/regattas/{regatta-name}/datamining/...</tt>
               requests; a refactoring attempt accidentally introduced this problem which has now been resolved.</li>
           <li>Fixed an issue with column factors other than 1 in combination with excluding worst scores; previously,
               the points before multiplication by the column factor were compared for discarding.
               With this, the display of those discards has also been fixed such that the scaled number is displayed
               with a strike-through.</li>
         </ul>
         <h5 class="articleSubheadline">May 2022</h5>
         <ul class="bulletList">
           <li>Bug fix: when the "Boats" column is expanded for a race in which not all entries of the leaderboard
               compete, the race won't expand properly. Now it does.</li>
         </ul>
         <h5 class="articleSubheadline">April 2022</h5>
         <ul class="bulletList">
           <li>Fixed a regression regarding the secondary metric in the "Competitor Charts." As we had
               introduced mechanisms that avoid redundant data requests by the chart component, a bug crept
               in which caused problems when users selected a secondary metric to be displayed in the Competitor
               Charts view. This has now been fixed.</li>
           <li>Not an April Fools' joke: We are introducing a subscription model for the SAP Sailing Analytics
               with the beginning of April 2022. You now have the chance to support the project, going forward,
               by subscribing to the "Premium" plan which grants you continued access to the advanced features
               of the solution. All your payments will be used to support, maintain, operate and further develop
               the solution. You can submit your thoughts and requests and follow our progress at
               <a href="https://bugzilla.sapsailing.com/">bugzilla.sapsailing.com</a>. Thank you for your
               continued support and understanding!.</li>
           <li>Minor bug fix: the tool tips on the time slider markers in the race player are now properly updated
               when, e.g., the start time changes.</li>
           <li>Aborted and postponed races with dependent start times now have their status field correctly filled
               in the "Regatta Overview" page.</li>
           <li>The search results page now shows a progress indicator until all search results from all servers
               queried have been received.</li>
           <li>Added a low-point scoring scheme variant that requires three wins in the medal series, including any
               wins from an optional carry-forward column in the medal series. This is a variant of the low-point
               scoring scheme that requires two wins in the medal series.</li>
           <li><a href="/gwt/DataMining.html">Data mining</a> has become a subscribable option now. You can find it
               in the top-level menu bar. Its two plans ("all" including live events, or "archive" which excludes
               current live events) can also be tried for a short time for free.</li>
           <li>Simulator and Data Mining are now always part of the top-level menu bar and can easily be subscribed
               to from there.</li>
           <li>"Sailing Loves Photography" images and videos for the Home.html landing page are now collected across
               ten years of events, not only one year.</li>
         </ul>
         <h5 class="articleSubheadline">December 2021</h5>
         <ul class="bulletList">
           <li>The strategy simulator (see <a href="https://sapsailing.com/gwt/Simulator.html">https://sapsailing.com/gwt/Simulator.html</a>)
               now offers all the boat polars trained during more than 25,000 races tracked.
           </li>
         </ul>
         <h5 class="articleSubheadline">November 2021</h5>
         <ul class="bulletList">
           <li>When signing up for a new user account, the user name is now trimmed, meaning that
               leading and trailing whitespace / blank characters are removed. For example, if you
               sign up for a user name " abc123 " it will become "abc123". This change is inteneded
               to help those using touch-screen keyboards with auto-completion where particularly
               trailing blanks are often appended, leading to problems logging in to these accounts
               if the trailing blank remains part of the username but then are not provided during
               the login process.</li>
         </ul>
         <h5 class="articleSubheadline">October 2021</h5>
         <ul class="bulletList">
           <li>The <a href="/gwt/DataMining.html">Data Mining</a> module now has additional statistics for a competitor's
               start performance, such as the absolute and normalized distance from the starboard side of the start line,
               projected onto the start line, the distance to the next boat to port/starboard at the start projected
               onto the start line, and the windward/line-perpendicular distances to the port/starboard neighbors
               at the start line.</li>
           <li>More enhancements to the DataMining module, e.g., adding the IRM / penalty code as a filter / grouping
               dimension, and providing sums of absolute distances to neighbors at start line.</li>
           <li>Performance improvements for ORC Performance Curve Scoring, especially for the "WINDWARD_LEEWARD_REAL_LIVE"
               leg type.</li>
           <li>Performance improvements for leaderboards with few or only a single column but many competitors by parallelizing
               calculations across competitors, too.</li>
           <li>When a boat name but no competitor short name is provided, the boat name now takes precedence over the sail number in the
               little flag-shaped overlays on the race map.</li>
         </ul>
         <h5 class="articleSubheadline">September 2021</h5>
         <ul class="bulletList">
           <li>On race board it is now possible to add media files from disc or capture video and sound directly from mobile device.</li>
           <li>Also in the media gallery of the event page it is now possible to add photos and videos from disc or capture them from smartphone.</li>
           <li>Due to the growing number of functions we cleaned up the race board. The most of the buttons moved to a launch pad.
               The features are now arranged in one place within a uniform look and are available with a maximum of two short clicks.
               This creates a lot more space for the actual race map.</li>
         </ul>
         <h5 class="articleSubheadline">July 2021</h5>
         <ul class="bulletList">
           <li>The data mining module (<a href="/gwt/DataMining.html">/gwt/DataMining.html</a>) now offers additional
               metrics regarding the regular wind-based rank calculation for upwind and downwind legs as well as
               hypothetical ranks calculated for upwind and downwind legs ignoring wind information and instead
               projecting onto the Rhumb line. This allows for analyzing the effects of a wind-based ranking
               on upwind and downwind legs.</li>
           <li>Groups are now ordered by name in the drop-down for setting the default creation group
               under "User Details."</li>
           <li>A Slovenian translation of the user interface has been added.</li>
           <li>The IOC code for "Russian Olympic Committee" has been added under the "ROC" abbreviation, together
               with the IOC-provided flag.</li>
           <li>Fixed a regression: competitors are now again selected correctly for the Start Analysis and for the
               Winning Lanes modes of the race viewer.</li>
           <li>When the streamlet settings are changed using the wind indicator on the map, these settings are now
               also stored in the user profile as if they had been changed via the map settings dialog.</li>
           <li>Boat scaling on large zoom levels has been fixed. The pixel size now better corresponds to the
               boat class's hull length and beam.</li>
           <li>An issue with re-drawing the "Progression" chart during live races has been fixed.</li>
           <li>Wind arrows now fade according to their fading confidence, e.g., when a WindBot device has been
               switched off, or if Wind Finder samples have aged by ten minutes or more.</li>
           <li>The place for which the "combined wind" is calculated is now closer to the "middle of the course" than
               before. Before, each waypoint's position was considered for the average, overemphasizing leeward waypoints
               for windward-leeward courses, for example. Now, each leg's middle position is considered for the average,
               with a weight that corresponds to the leg's length. This results in an average that virtually takes into
               account every single point on each sailed leg's rhumb line. Note, though, that the positions are taken based
               on the mark positions at the time point requested. If marks are moved around the course this will have an
               effect, obviously, on how this average is calculated.</li>
         </ul>
         <h5 class="articleSubheadline">June 2021</h5>
         <ul class="bulletList">
           <li>The advantage line now also (again) shows after the first competitor has crossed the finish line.</li>
           <li>Dampening of wind, in particular the estimation from courses over ground (COG),
               has been improved. The confidences inferred from cluster sizes sailing on separate tacks
               are now growing more smoothly for small fleet sizes and hence cause less unexpected
               "jumps" in estimated wind directions. Base confidence of wind estimations, compared
               to sensor-based measurements, has been slightly reduced, as has the base confidence for
               estimations from downwind legs.</li>
           <li>Wind streamlet overlay on race map now scales better for long-distance races. Its spatial
               interpolation is now a much closer approximation of the server-side wind field used which
               also leads to smoother transitions between sensors distributed across the race course area.</li>
           <li>Usernames with leading/trailing space characters can no longer be created in the sign-up dialog.
               Access to existing accounts with such names now need explicit confirmation during sign-in and
               password recovery to make users aware of the problem.</li>
         </ul>
         <h5 class="articleSubheadline">May 2021</h5>
         <ul class="bulletList">
           <li>Added language support for Danish (Dansk).</li>
           <li>The stage will from now on randomize the order of long-running events that span more than
               two weeks, assuming that those are actually event <em>series</em>, so these won't
               dominate the stage.</li>
           <li>Fixed a problem that occurred with empty tracks while trying to display a leaderboard.
               The issue was displayed to users as error message at the bottom of the race board:
               "Error trying to obtain leaderboard contents: ...".</li>
           <li>The advantage line will now also be shown reliably after the first competitors have
               finished the race.</li>

               returned the query results. This is now fixed.</li>

               and the <tt>/sailingserver/api/v2/leaderboards/{name}</tt> end points. The former also contains the average XTE values (signed and absolute)
               for all legs. For the latter, specify one or more of the following new detail types:
               <ul>
                 <li><tt>LEG_CURRENT_ABSOLUTE_CROSS_TRACK_ERROR_IN_METERS</tt> produces the new field <tt>legCurrentAbsoluteCrossTrackErrorInMeters</tt></li>

            <li>A new wind source that estimates true wind direction and speed from maneuvers is available.
                It has been trained using machine learning techniques, based on approximately 12 million
                maneuvers that the SAP Sailing Analytics have tracked and classified so far. It is intended
                to serve as a fallback wind source in case the wind direction is not being made available
                to a tracked race in any other way (entry through the Race Manager app, the web page or
                estimated based on the first upwind leg's direction). Therefore, the confidence level has
                been set fairly low, hence this wind source will always be outweighed by any real wind
                sensor out on the course, but it will help "bootstrap" true wind direction which then
                also helps the already existing wind direction estimation that clusters the tracks of
                a race into upwind and downwind, then by the tacks the boats are on and then averages
                the COG values to obtain a TWD approximation. With the new maneuver-based wind source

               selected in the settings if before zooming the resolution had to be reduced to remain under the limit of
               data points that can be requested from the server in one round trip.</li>

            <li>The language preference set in the user profile (if any), now also affects the website's language.
               Formerly, this preference affected the language of notification mails only. Be aware of the fact, that
               signing in will not force the page to be shown in the user's preferred language. It will only take effect
               when refreshing the page manually or opening a new one, in order to prevent the state of the currently
               opened page to get lost. After a sign out (and another page reload) the language preference will stop to
               take effect.</li>
            <li>There are additional column types in the leaderboard that show per leg, per race and overall
               statistics for distance foiled and duration foiled. This allows for quick competitor comparisons
               regarding these figures which are so important for any foiling boat class. Note, that this feature is
               also available on overall leaderboards, providing foiling stats across an entire season or event series.
            </li>
            <li>When a leaderboard belongs to a leaderboard group with an overall (series) leaderboard and the
               leaderboard has no scores at all yet for a competitor, that competitor won't be assigned a score in the
               overall (series) leaderboard either. This way, when an act or event has its leaderboard already linked to
               the series leaderboard group, no scores will show in the series leaderboard before the act/event starts
               producing scores for the competitors.</li>

               currently shows minimum and maximum values for averages, and the tool tip visualizes those numerically,
               together with the number of elements from which the average was drawn.
            </li>
            <li>The <tt>DataMining.html</tt> module now reacts on clicks on bars in the result chart and triggers a
               corresponding drill-down operation, adding the first grouping key value as a new filter and removing the
               grouping dimension. If that was the last dimension removed, the user is asked to provide a new grouping
               dimension.

               are detected based on the total number of tracked races known (races having GPS data and a valid start
               date). Anniversary types currently known are round quarters like 10'000, 25'000, and 50'000 as well as
               numbers where all digits are the same like 11'111 or 22'222. Some time before such a milestone is
               reached, a countdown is shown on the start page. When an anniversary is reached, the determined race is
               shown at the same place.</li>

               statistics can be found at the end of the list of events for a year. To see statistics of a past year,
               you need to expand the list of events for that year.</li>
            <li>The simulation overlay is now also available prior to the start of a live race. It can therefore,
               e.g., be used to "predict" the best course on the first upwind leg based on the latest wind measurements.
            </li>
            <li>In several places you can now find statistics regarding the highest speed and the competitor that

               assigning a static position can now be removed using the "Delete Fix" pop-up menu item in the Mark
               Position Editor. It will require removing and re-tracking the race to make the removal take effect.</li>
            <li>In <code>/gwt/RaceBoard.html</code> it's now possible to display an overlay that shows the
               estimated duration based on the course and the current wind conditions. To show this information, you
               need to select the respective option in the map's settings dialog. The option's visibility depends on the
               availability of sufficient polar data for the boat class.
            </li>
            <li>In <code>/gwt/RaceBoard.html</code> it isn't possible anymore to select other races to be shown in
               the embedded leaderboard. This possibility caused several problems in the past. The leaderboard will now
               always stick to the single race for which the raceboard was opened.
            </li>
            <li>The autoplay sites have been re-implemented from ground up:
               <ul>
                  <li>Autoplay now uses the new settings framework</li>
                  <li>Classic-Autoplay represents the old autoplay</li>
                  <li>Sixty-Inch-Autoplay is a new, more complex, redesigned, multiview autoplay targeted at big

         <ul class="bulletList">
            <li>Several improvements were implemented regarding user settings:
               <ul>
                  <li>Document settings are saved as delta to the user defaults instead of the delta to the system
                     defaults. In cases where a setting has the value 'A' as system default and 'B' as user default,
                     it's now possible to set it back to 'A' for a document. Settings stored before this change will
                     continue to work with the old overwriting semantic.</li>
                  <li>Collection based settings are now stored as delta to the default set of values. This means
                     that removals and additions are being recorded instead of all values of a setting. Having value 'A'
                     as system default and adding 'B' for the user default and 'C' for one document will select values
                     'A', 'B' and 'C' for the document.</li>
                  <li>Settings dialogs now have a 'reset to default' button. When pressing this button, user
                     defaults as well as the current document settings are being reset to the system defaults. In
                     addition, the settings dialog is updated to show the system defaults. Those defaults will only take
                     effect for the current view when pressing ok.</li>
                  <li>User settings can now also be saved for <code>/gwt/RaceBoard.html</code>. Be aware that
                     different modes have distinct settings so that defaults defined for one mode do not have any effect
                     on other modes.
                  </li>
                  <li>On the user profile page you can now find a list of all stored settings. You can show the
                     technical settings data and remove specific setting entries.</li>
               </ul>

         <h5 class="articleSubheadline">May 2017</h5>
         <ul class="bulletList">
            <li>It's now possible to show nationality flags in addition to competitor images in leaderboards if
               both are available. If no competitor images are available, this won't have any effect. You can activate
               this option through the leaderboard settings dialog to be found in various views.</li>
         </ul>

         <h5 class="articleSubheadline">April 2017</h5>
         <ul class="bulletList">
            <li>Several pages are now enabled to save user settings with the following specifics:
               <ul>
                  <li>In settings dialogs there is a "Make default" button in the lower-left corner which is
                     displayed when saving of settings is enabled. A click on that button causes the system to use the
                     new settings as default values for the same page. This is independent of a race, event or
                     leaderboard to be shown.</li>
                  <li>A click on OK button causes the system to store the settings as document settings. Document
                     settings are only used for the same event, leaderboard or race. When the page is opened for e.g.
                     the same race, the settings used last time are loaded.</li>
                  <li>Settings saved this way are stored locally in the browser's local storage and in the user
                     profile if you are logged in.</li>
                  <li>Settings can be overwritten by URL parameters.</li>
               </ul> The following pages are now enabled to provide user settings:

                  <li><code>/gwt/Leaderboard.html</code></li>
                  <li><code>/gwt/RegattaOverview.html</code></li>
                  <li>Leaderboards embedded in <code>/gwt/Home.html</code></li>
               </ul> This feature required changing several URL parameters, which means that previously saved bookmarks might
               work slightly different.
            </li>
            <li>The maneuver loss calculation for penalty circles has been improved. Previously, the end of the
               penalty circle maneuver was considered to be at the last of the two adjacent tack/gybe maneuvers. This,
               usually, is earlier than when approaching the course over ground at the beginning of the penalty circle
               again. With this, the extrapolation of the speed/course at the beginning of the maneuver did not last
               long enough. Furthermore, penalties with strong accelerations during the gybing phase could have led to
               an incorrect inference of the speed and course at the beginning of the maneuver. Both of these issues
               have now been fixed, leading to good results also in very specific and unusual speed developments during
               a penalty circle maneuver.</li>
            <li>The advantage line display has been fixed for legs changing their type (upwind/downwind/reach)
               while the race is going on. It now uses the leg type at the same current time point that the leaderboard
               uses for calculating the competitor ranking.</li>
            <li>Images in the overall image gallery ("Photographers love Sailing") are now linked with the events
               to which they belong. Clicking the image navigates to the event page.</li>

               set your preferred language.</li>
            <li>The application's locale now switches based on the client's "Accept-Language" HTTP header field.
               This means that the application in all its parts will show in the user's default language if supported,
               defaulting to English otherwise.</li>

            <li>The definition of "ride height" for foiling sensors has been changed. Instead of showing the ride
               height calculated by the sensor we are now showing the minimum of the port and starboard ride heights.
               Therefore, this new definition of ride height can be seen as the distance of lowest hull part from the
               water.</li>

         <ul class="bulletList">
            <li>An issue with live re-calculation of the maximum speed over ground (SOG) values has been fixed. In
               some circumstances it was possible that new live data did not properly update the MaxSOG figures. Since
               this depended on the timing of read and write access it could have led to different values for different
               server instances, giving confusing results. The fix provided now ensures that the MaxSOG values are
               properly evaluated when new data has arrived.</li>
            <li>The buoy zone radius is now determined by a configurable regatta property. By default, it is set to
               two hull lengths, and a regatta administrator may choose to change it to any other factor such as 3 or
               2.5. This determines the default used in the race viewer (RaceBoard.html). Users can still change the
               radius in the map settings to any arbitrary number, deviating from what has "officially" been set for the
               regatta.</li>

                  <li>Race analysis: Shows the race results by setting the timer to the end of the race. <i>This
                        option is only available, if the race is already finished.</i>

                     of the best starters within the competitor chart (zoomed to start). <i>This option is only
                        available, if the race is already started.</i>

            <li>On the user profile page you now can maintain a list of you favorite boat classes and competitors.
               You can also opt in for notification mails about your favorites to stay informed. A requirement for
               notification mails to work for you is that you entered a valid mail address to your user profile and
               verified the address by clicking the link that has been sent via email.</li>
            <li>Users now may choose their preferred language on the user profile page. Currently only the mail
               notification mechanism will accept this setting to send mails in the preferred language. This also
               prepares additional language sensitive feature, e.g. automatically switching the website to your
               preferred language when logged in.</li>
            <li>The leaderboard now has a new measure value called "Ride height", which shows the ride height on
               foils of a competitor, if respective data is available (currently ESS only). This information can also be
               shown in the competitor chart on the RaceBaord page.</li>

               Replay mode. You may also use just seconds, as in <tt>t=1234</tt> which makes specifying a time <em>before</em>

               the mark's position, the last known position at or before the time point requested will be used. The
               "jumping" of marks in the UI that may otherwise be caused by this is ameliorated by introducing the same

               line, a transparent, wider line is activated behind it that acts as a buffer for the thin line, where the
               text displayed by the hover is still shown. This makes it easier to hover over the lines. These wider
               lines can be made semi transparent instead of transparent by unticking the corresponding checkbox in the
               settings of the race map. Furthermore the stroke weight of the wider lines can be configured in the same
               settings dialog.</li>
            <li>The race viewer (RaceBoard.html) now intelligently chooses a layout that suits the screen size.
               When only little horizontal space is available, only the sail number and nationality but not the
               competitor's long name is displayed by default. When vertical space is scarce, competitor and wind charts
               are disabled and more horizontal space can be given to the time slider at the bottom. The leaderboard
               section can then be scaled to smaller widths and will reduce the column widths better than in the past.</li>
            <li>With the changes described above, the RaceBoard is now also accessible from the races page on
               mobile devices.</li>
            <li>For overall / series leaderboards such as a national sailing league or the Extreme Sailing Series,
               the live status of the overall leaderboard is now indicated. As long as a live race is ongoing, the
               respective column in the overall leaderboard is highlighted, and a comment is displayed that indicates
               which regatta is currently still live.</li>
         </ul>

         <h5 class="articleSubheadline">November 2015</h5>

         <ul class="bulletList">
            <li>The smartphone page provides some structural navigation items for several pages in the upper right
               burger menu. You will see links to e.g. events, regattas and series when navigating on event and series
               pages.</li>
            <li>It is now possible to filter for competitors in the race list of events/regattas. If competitor
               information is available, there is a filter box in the upper right corner of the races page. The filter
               is searching for competitors by sail ID as well as the competitor's name.</li>
            <li>Regattas can now be filtered by boat category in the smartphone page. The filter will be shown for
               events with multiple regattas if there is more than on boat category associated with the event.</li>
         </ul>

         <h5 class="articleSubheadline">October 2015</h5>

         <ul class="bulletList">
            <li>A variety of tablets will now show the desktop page by default. The mobile version of the website
               is primarily designed to be used on smartphones, but you can manually switch back to the mobile version
               by clicking the corresponding link in the page footer.</li>
            <li>There is some amount of caching on the web page to reduce the consumed traffic for mobile users.
               Contents aren't loaded again on each page switch. This improves the traffic consumption and loading speed
               on fast page switches.</li>
            <li>The fullscreen image viewer (start page and event media page) can automatically slide through the
               images. This can be turned on by clicking the corresponding icon in the upper right corner of the
               fullscreen viewer.</li>
            <li>There is an optimized search and results page for mobile devices now.</li>
         </ul>

         <h5 class="articleSubheadline">September 2015</h5>

         <ul class="bulletList">
            <li>Races in the event/regatta race list can now be shown in 'competition format'. In this format the
               races and flights are shown in a structural view. In contrast to the default list view there is no
               grouping by live and finished states and all (including upcoming) races/flights are shown in one
               structural view.</li>
            <li>The mobile page now provides regatta overview pages for events having multiple regattas. This page
               shows live races, an excerpt of the current results as well as statistics for the regatta.</li>
         </ul>

         <h5 class="articleSubheadline">August 2015</h5>

         <ul class="bulletList">
            <li>Series events appear as only one entry in the events list, with a marker that this is only one of a
               certain number of events in a series. This way, the many series events don't produce clutter in the
               events list.</li>
            <li>Bug fix: memory leaks for distance cache have been solved. The issue could also lead to endless
               recursions, ultimately leading to server lock-ups.</li>
            <li>Bug fix: master data import detached race logs and regatta logs from database. Log entries added
               after import on the importing server were not written to the database and therefore were lost upon server
               restart.</li>
            <li>There is a smartphone-optimized version of the "solutions" page known from the desktop.</li>
            <li>The smartphone event history now has a slider that allows swiping through the events of a year.</li>
         </ul>

         <h5 class="articleSubheadline">July 2015</h5>

         <ul class="bulletList">
            <li>Major improvements to the web page, with specific enhancements for smartphone users. Race lists are
               now sortable by various criteria by clicking on the column headers. A new fancy progress indicator now
               also provides visual feedback for multi-fleet regattas. A news ticker box has been implemented, and the
               event overview page can hold a video player on its stage. The event media gallery section has been
               greatly improved.</li>
            <li>Fixed a bug in the wind streamlet visualization. Now the wind streamlets correctly show the wind at
               the location selected also in wind-up mode.</li>
            <li>Added the "Course Geometry" option to the map display. With this option selected, the map will show
               an info text for each leg and the start and finish line (only for one of start/finish line if they are
               identical), telling the length of the leg or line, respectively, and its angle to the wind. For the start
               and finish line the advantage of the favored side is shown in meters.</li>
            <li>The SAP Sailing Analytics start page is now available in the smartphone version. This page features
               some events that are currently interesting as well as showing a quickfinder for a variety of recent and
               upcoming events. Previously, the start page redirected to the event history.</li>
         </ul>

         <h5 class="articleSubheadline">May 2015</h5>

         <ul class="bulletList">
            <li>Competitors can have a separate flag image, such as a club flag to be displayed instead of the
               nationality flag usually displayed with the sail number. This enables national league events to display
               the club flags consistently when all nation flags would be the same anyway.</li>
            <li>The wind estimation from the tracked courses over ground has been improved. It now takes into
               account any polar data available for the boat class concerned. In particular, this helps to rule out very
               unlikely gybing angles in downwind clusters that otherwise could have led to an incorrect split of the
               downwind fleet into two clusters where actually all boats were on the same tack.</li>
            <li>Some significant improvements have been applied to the simulator feature which is embedded in the
               race viewer since some time now. The simulator now copes with very shifty wind conditions and finds
               solutions in scenarios where an upwind leg flips to a reach or even into a downwind leg over time.</li>
         </ul>

         <h5 class="articleSubheadline">April 2015</h5>

         <ul class="bulletList">
            <li>There is a new map setting "Wind-Up (show wind from top of map)". Selecting it will align the map's
               top with the combined true wind average direction around the time currently selected in the time slider.
               In this new view there are limitations as to how far you can zoom out. Furthermore, you will not be able
               to use the Satellite view with this setting. Tip: if you want to re-align to wind-up after a major wind
               shift, un-check the setting, confirm the setting change, then set it again. A compass shows the true
               north orientation. Clicking the compass will toggle between wind-up and north-up display.</li>
            <li>Bug fixes around addition of the "Regatta Rank" column in the leaderboard which could have
               distorted the leaderboard's column layout under certain conditions.</li>
            <li>Bug fix for cumulative points in the leaderboard ("Show added scores for each entry in
               leaderboard"). With this setting, scores of competitors not tracked in the current race were not
               correctly represented and may have stayed blank.</li>
            <li>Bug fix for the leg counter in the regatta page: when the first boat has finished, the leg counter
               went to zero (e.g., "0 of 8"). This has now been fixed, and it will show, e.g., "8 of 8" upon the first
               boat crossing the finish line.</li>
         </ul>

         <h5 class="articleSubheadline">March 2015</h5>

         <ul class="bulletList">
            <li>Added competitor chart type for Course Over Ground (COG)</li>
            <li>Added leaderboard column and competitor chart entry for distances considering gate starts. With
               gate starts, late starters sail a shorter distance in their first leg. To still make distances
               comparable, a new metric has been introduced that for a gate start adds the distance between the port
               side of the start line and the position where the competitor started to the distance sailed in the first
               leg.</li>
            <li>The weights of the wind measurement units, the wind estimation and manual wind inputs by the race
               committee are now used properly for the wind streamlet visualization. This fixes issues with exaggerated
               weights for an estimated wind direction of very low confidence.</li>
            <li>The expand/collapse toggle button in the race viewer's time panel has correct arrows now.</li>
         </ul>

         <h5 class="articleSubheadline">February 2015</h5>

         <ul class="bulletList">
            <li>The leaderboard offers a new column: "Start delay." It shows the number of seconds that passed
               since the race start and the time the competitor passes the start mark / start line. As usual, you can
               sort for this column. For line starts, this is a fairly direct measure of start quality except for port
               starts which may have to be considered differently. For gate starts, you can use this measure to find out
               about early and late starters and dig into possible correlations between results and start time point.</li>
         </ul>

         <h5 class="articleSubheadline">January 2015</h5>

         <ul class="bulletList">
            <li>The race viewer ("RaceBoard.html") now offers a new option in the map settings: "Show simulation
               overlay". Checking this feature will simulate the current leader's leg using different strategies and
               using the wind as it has been measured and estimated. This feature becomes particularly interesting when
               combined with the "Show wind streamlets overlay" feature that visualizes the spatial distribution of the
               wind field over the course.</li>
            <li>The race viewer is now more resilient against exceptional conditions such as the missing of all
               wind information and the missing of a course with its waypoints. If no wind information is available at
               all (no wind direction indicator is then shown in the upper left corner of the map) then all ranking and
               distances will be based on a projection onto the course instead of onto the wind direction, even for
               upwind and downwind legs.</li>
         </ul>

         <h5 class="articleSubheadline">September 2014</h5>

         <ul class="bulletList">
            <li>The search feature now also includes results from currently ongoing events that may not yet be
               included in our archive. Search keywords are now properly used in constructing the query.</li>
         </ul>

         <h5 class="articleSubheadline">August 2014</h5>

         <ul class="bulletList">
            <li>The 2D race viewer, also known as the "Race Board," now comes with a fresh, new design. The orange
               checkbox toggle buttons that open or close views such as the leaderboard or the charts for wind and
               competitor comparison, have been replaced by tabs with "&gt;&gt;" symbols. Clicking on those will expand
               or collapse the respective view. The views can now be resized using the handles attached to the dividers
               separating the views. They work much better on mobile and touch devices than the splitters used
               previously did. The settings buttons that used to be integrated with the orange toggle checkbox buttons
               have now been moved into the views that they control. For example, the map settings button is now
               displayed on the map, below the zoom control on the right map border.</li>
            <li>The leaderboard now has an improved search and filter control. Above the table displaying the
               competitors and their figures is a new field with a text input that you can use to filter for
               competitors, by their sail number or their name. While filtered, use the checkboxes in front of the table
               row to add the competitor to or remove it from the selection. Use the "X" button to the right of the
               search input field to clear the search. To the left of the search input field is a filter symbol that you
               can use to select and create advanced filtering rules, such as filtering by rank or nationality. Left of
               the filter button is the leaderboard settings button.</li>
            <li>The leaderboard has a new first column: a selection check box. We hope this makes it easier in
               particular for users on mobile or other touch devices to select more than one competitor at a time. The
               old-style multi-selection using the Control and Shift keys, as known well from typical desktop file
               explorers, still work like they did before. Note that it is possible to sort for the checkbox column,
               putting the selected competitors at the top of the leaderboard.</li>
            <li>When using the auto-zoom feature from the map settings, boats and wind streamlets will now continue
               to move smoothly as long as the map only needs panning. Please also note that auto-zooming to "tails" may
               slow down the display considerable, particularly when tracking at high frequency.</li>
            <li>When viewing a single race, the leaderboard now by default does no longer show the regatta rank as
               the first column (and not as the second one either, given that the first column now usually shows the
               checkboxes used for selecting items). If you'd like to get the regatta rank column back, also when
               looking at a single race, please choose it from the leaderboard settings dialog where you can find it in
               the "Overall Details" section. It may still be a nice column to have when following the last race in a
               regatta. If you're just interested in the relative regatta rank ordering you may as well sort by the
               right-most total points column which (surprising to some but welcome by most) sorts by the regatta rank
               and not by the plain points sum (taking into account medal race and gold/silver/... fleet
               participations).</li>
         </ul>

         <h5 class="articleSubheadline">July 2014</h5>

         <ul class="bulletList">
            <li>The advantage line now uses the wind at the position in the middle of the leg that the competitor
               to which the line is attached is currently sailing in. Before, the "global" wind average was used which
               is still displayed in the top left corner of the map. You can understand the details by turning on the
               "Streamlet" wind visualization in the Map Settings.</li>
            <li>Faster wind streamlet loading: when you activate the streamlets for wind visualization, they now
               display much faster.</li>
            <li>Faster boat position display: We found that what you're probably the most interested in when you
               first open a race map or move the time slider to some very different point in time is the position of the
               boats at that point in time; and you want to know it fast. The tails which show how the boats got there
               are also interesting, but you won't blame us as much if it takes a little bit to update them. So we've
               separated the placement of the boats from the drawing of their tails. Now you may blame us for the tails
               temporarily not being attached to the boats anymore ;-).</li>
         </ul>

         <h5 class="articleSubheadline">June 2014</h5>

         <ul class="bulletList">
            <li>In the "Maps" settings in the RaceBoard page there is a new checkbox named "Show wind streamlets
               overlay." If you select it and wait for about a minute, a complete wind field will be calculated and
               visualized as an overlay on top of the race course display. It reacts to you moving the time slider and
               shows how the wind differs at different locations on the course. Stronger and faster-moving streamlets
               mean stronger breeze.</li>
            <li>Wind is now calculated location-based. At locations closer to a sensor, that sensor has a higher
               influence on the local wind field than sensors further away. The wind estimations based on the courses
               sailed are assigned a location that corresponds with the "center of gravity" of the field that was used
               for the estimation. For example, if the fleet is approaching the windward mark and the wind sensor in on
               the committee boat on the leeward side of the course, the course-based estimation influences the assumed
               wind field more on the windward side whereas the sensor counts more for the leeward side.</li>
            <li>Switched to the latest version of the Highcharts charting framework. This leads to improvements
               especially on mobile devices. Charts can be zoomed using pinch gestures now.</li>
            <li>To support the use of the SAP Sailing Analytics also for live video streaming formats, we
               introduced a new URL parameter <tt>viewShowMapControls</tt> for the <tt>Spectator.html</tt> and the <tt>RaceBoard.html</tt>
               pages. Setting this parameter to "false" will suppress the zoom, pan and map type selection controls on
               the map display. Example: <a
               href="http://danishleague2014.sapsailing.com/gwt/Spectator.html?leaderboardGroupName=Danish%20League%202014&showRaceDetails=true&viewShowMapControls=false">http://danishleague2014.sapsailing.com/gwt/Spectator.html?leaderboardGroupName=Danish%20League%202014&showRaceDetails=true&viewShowMapControls=false</a>.
               When used for the <tt>Spectator.html</tt> URL, this will apply to all <tt>RaceBoard.html</tt> pages (all
               races) reached from there. Of course, the map can still be panned and zoomed using the usual mouse
               gestures. A left double click zooms in, a right double click zooms out. Zoom can also be controlled using
               the mouse wheel. And panning works by clicking on the map and dragging the mouse. Without the map type
               control, switching to satellite view is not possible (keep this in mind when tracking races in China, see
               below for Google's random coordinate transformations there).
            </li>
         </ul>

         <h5 class="articleSubheadline">May 2014</h5>

         <ul class="bulletList">
            <li>Fixed an issue with the wind speed charts. Charts that only had a single, unchanged wind speed
               crashed the browser. The solution scales the right hand side Y-axis denoting the wind speed such that it
               always starts at 0kts.</li>
            <li>Analysis of tacks and jibes around mark passings has now been improved. Before, a jibe followed by
               a tack that turns in the same direction (e.g., to port) so far was always called a penalty maneuver. Now,
               if a mark passing separates such a tack from such a jibe, no penalty is called anymore, and the two
               maneuvers are identified correctly.</li>
            <li>Another note on maneuver analysis: we received questions regarding the maneuvers involved in
               clearing an OCS. The SAP Sailing Analytics treat a clearing of an OCS, going back behind the start line
               and crossing it again, as if the competitor started again. In particular this means that all maneuvers
               prior to this new start do not count for the metrics; neither does the distance sailed between the first
               (OCS) start and the clear start.</li>
            <li>A hint regarding the "distance to start line" metrics: please keep in mind that currently this
               measurement is calculated as the distance of the GPS tracker from the line. Unless the tracker is mounted
               near the bow (or at the bow sprit, if any), the distance calculated this way will be greater than what
               counts for crossing the line. Ordering, comparing and aggregating over this figure still makes sense as
               long as you remember this detail.</li>
            <li>Introduced a new leaderboard entry "XTE +/-" featuring a signed cross-track error which shows for a
               leg and also aggregated for an entire race on which side of the leg a competitor stayed on average.
               Currently, the "side" is defined as viewing in the leg's direction, so "left" for a downwind leg is the
               same side as "right" for the corresponding upwind leg.</li>
         </ul>

         <h5 class="articleSubheadline">April 2014</h5>

         <ul class="bulletList">
            <li>China races, such as in Qingdao, may have the map background displayed at slightly wrong locations.
               This is due to an intentional random transformation that Google applies to GPS locations for China. You
               can circumvent this issue by switching to satellite view where the map background is displayed correctly.

            </li>
            <li>Fixed a bug that in some cases has caused the wind chart, the advantage line, the wind indicator on
               the map and the leaderboard to use slightly different wind values. The problem was related to different
               averaging and damping methods used for these values which has now been aligned.</li>
            <li>Fixed a bug that caused the time spent in a leg, race or regatta to always show the time at the end
               of the leg if the leg has been started by the competitor at the time point queried, e.g., by the time
               slider. While this did not have any serious effects in live mode, for replay races this left the leg time
               and race time constant at the total time spent so far up to the end of the last leg the competitor had
               started at that time.</li>

         <h5 class="articleSubheadline">March 2014</h5>

         <ul class="bulletList">
            <li>Added a new setting for a leaderboard called "Show added scores". Using this feature one can
               display added scores for each leaderboard entry. An added score is the sum over all scores from the first
               column to the current column. One can describe it as an intermediate overall score. This feature can be
               used to know the score until a specific race while another race is live and constantly changes the
               overall score.</li>

            <li>Added tooltips for leaderboard settings.</li>

            <li>Fixed HighPointOverall scheme to also break a tie by looking at the ranks of the last regatta.</li>

            <li>Progress indicator when expanding a race in the RaceBoard view</li>

            <li>Leaderboard column "GPS Lag" shows how far a competitor's GPS signal lags behind the average
               tracking quality. A background color bar classifies into good/ok/bad (green/yellow/red).</li>
         </ul>

         <h5 class="articleSubheadline">February 2014</h5>

         <ul class="bulletList">
            <li>Fixed an issue with boat rotation on Safari browsers</li>

            <li>Maneuver analysis now counts tacks and jibes based on wind at boat position and not based on leg
               type; subsequently, penalty circle analysis is now based on a tack and a jibe in close succession instead
               of a full circle.</li>

            <li>Regatta rank and overall rank in competitor chart of leaderboard panel has been fixed; it did
               erroneously display the rank of the particular race, not the regatta/overall rank after that race.</li>

            <li>Regatta overview now also displays all regatta leaderboards</li>

            <li>Boat colors match tail colors</li>

            <li>When selecting boats in leaderboard, de-selected boats' tails turn grey</li>

         </ul>


         <h5 class="articleSubheadline">January 2014</h5>

         <ul class="bulletList">
            <li>Boat movement animated smoothly</li>

            <li>Start and Finish line show line parameters (length, angle to wind, advantage) when mouse hovers
               over them</li>

            <li>Start line has a count-down indicator displayed next to it before the start. The count-down is also
               displayed underneath the time slider</li>

            <li>Competitor and Wind charts show pre-start data where possible</li>

            <li>Competitors can be assigned a fixed color which they will keep for all races in a regatta</li>

            <li>By default, videos are now shown in a moveable, resizable box embedded in the web page. For a two
               screen setup, the embedded box can be popped out to a dedicated browser window.</li>

            <li>Official score corrections for historic races are only applied after the respective competitor
               finished the race. Therefore, in-between race scores now correspond with tracking, regardless of final
               corrected score.</li>

            <li>By using negative playback speed (e.g., -1), replays can be run backwards.</li>
