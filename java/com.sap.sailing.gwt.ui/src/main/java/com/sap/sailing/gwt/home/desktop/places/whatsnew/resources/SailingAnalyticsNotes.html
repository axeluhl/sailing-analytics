         <ul class="bulletList">
            <li>Bug fix: the "Edit Mark Passings" panel showed only up to 15 waypoints.</li>
            <li>Competitors not assigned to any fleet will no longer be sorted in between a Gold
                and a Silver fleet but will end up "at the bottom" of the leaderboard.</li>
            <li>Bug fix: when a split-fleet series had results only entered manually as score
                corrections, the progress bars for the series were not shown properly. All
                fleets would be considered finished although some may not have seen results.</li>
         </ul>
         <h5 class="articleSubheadline">September 2025</h5>
         <ul class="bulletList">
            <li>Added CSV export for polar data histograms in Data Mining.</li>
         </ul>
         <h5 class="articleSubheadline">June 2025</h5>
         <ul class="bulletList">
            <li>Bug fix: the refresh interval in the Races/Tracking list ran into an overflow when races
                were scheduled more than 25 days in the future, leading to "flickering" Tracking buttons
                and excessive re-loading activity.</li>
         </ul>
         <h5 class="articleSubheadline">April 2025</h5>
         <ul class="bulletList">
           <li>Users can now file take-down requests for media assets displayed on the web site. This includes
               event stage/logo/teaser/gallery images and videos, as well as competitor images and competitor flags.
               For all these assets, a little semi-transparent three-dots button is displayed in the top-left
               corner of the image/video tile. When you are logged-in, with a validated e-mail address, click the
               three-dot button, and a popup dialog allows you to provide additional input and then submit the
               take-down request, which will lead to an e-mail being sent to support@sapsailing.com.</li>
         </ul>
         <h5 class="articleSubheadline">April 2025</h5>
         <ul class="bulletList">
            <li>When viewing the map in wind-up (instead of north-up) orientation, we now use the "VECTOR"
                Google Maps rendering type instead of "magically" mapping the race course to the middle of
                the Atlantic and virtually turning the coordinate system such that the wind seems to blow
                from the north. This way, as you zoom out from the race course you can still see the
                race in its original environment, particularly if it's an inshore or near-shore event.<p>
                In case your browser does not support VECTOR-based maps display, the previous "magical"
                wind-up implementation continues to be used. This can, e.g., be necessary when you run
                a browser inside a virtual environment, such as a VNC server or a Citrix client, or if
                your browser or graphics drivers don't support WebGL2.
                </li>
            <li>The wind ladder now shows reliably when switched on in the map settings. Note that the time
                slider needs to be at a time after the race start for the ladder to be shown.</li>
         </ul>
         <h5 class="articleSubheadline">March 2025</h5>
         <ul class="bulletList">
            <li>A new AI Agent based on <a href="https://help.sap.com/docs/sap-ai-core/sap-ai-core-service-guide/what-is-sap-ai-core">SAP AI Core</a>
                has been integrated with the solution. When configured for an event (see also <a href="/release_notes_admin.html">the administration release notes for March 2025</a>),
                the agent will generate comments in the race viewer's Tags column (right of the map) that explain what
                happens during the race.</li>
            <li>We introduced stricter Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) headers in our responses and by default now
                disallow the integration of our solution in &lt;iframe&gt; HTML elements for security reasons.
                Should you have a scenario that is impeded by these security measures and you feel your scenario
                is a valid one that we should support, please get in touch
                (<a href="mailto:support@sapsailing.com">support@sapsailing.com</a>).</li>
            <li>Failed password authentication attempts now lead to an increasing delay for accepting
                the next password authentication attempt for the same user.</li>
            <li>User account creation is limited now to one new user account per client IP address per minute.</li>
            <li>A failing attempt to authenticate a request with a bearer token, as obtained from
                <a href="https://sapsailing.com/security/api/restsecurity/access_token">/security/api/restsecurity/access_token</a>,
                will ban the requesting client IP address for a gradually increasing amount of time.</li>
            <li>The minimum complexity of new passwords has been increased.</li>
            <li>Added missing <tt>startTack</tt> field to <tt>.../startanalysis</tt> REST API method</li>
         </ul>
         <h5 class="articleSubheadline">February 2025</h5>
         <ul class="bulletList">
            <li>There are new importers for the Vakaros CSV file format. See details in the
                <a href="/release_notes_admin.html">administrative release notes</a>.</li>
            <li>Premium users now see a new leaderboard column for "Percent Target Boat Speed" which
                corresponds with the figures shown in the respective tail color and competitor chart
                selection.</li>
            <li>Percent Target Boat Speed for ORC Performance Curve Scoring (PCS) is now calculated based
                on each boat's measurement certificate, using the ratio between the implied wind at the
                current time point and the actual wind speed for the boat's position at that time.</li>
            <li>Fixed Data Mining issue: maneuvers, GPS, and Bravo fixes were filtered by average leg wind
                conditions instead of the maneuvers/GPS/Bravo fix's specific wind conditions. However,
                when reporting the results respect the specific wind conditions, potentially leading to
                inconsistencies.</li>
            <li>Assembling a "Sailor Profile" (see
                <a href="https://www.sapsailing.com/gwt/Home.html#/user/profile/sailorprofile/:">https://www.sapsailing.com/gwt/Home.html#/user/profile/sailorprofile/:</a>)
                now has an improved competitor search facility. The search keywords will be split along
                whitespace characters, so you can use multiple keywords in your search and split them by
                spaces. Sail numbers of competitors with fixed boat assignments will now be considered in
                the search, making this consistent with the display of the suggested items which also
                contain the sail numbers where available. Furthermore, the suggest box no longer suggests
                items that are already contained in the sailor profile's competitor selection. This makes
                assembling the competitor set of a sailor profile easier for larger numbers of items.</li>
            <li>Event seasons such as historic Extreme Sailing Series events or some league events were
                troubled by a data migration issue in connection with a new TracAPI major release 4.0.0
                and did not load correct course mark positions anymore. This problem has now been fixed
                on TracTrac's side, and after loading all content again, all events should now have their mark
                positions back.</li>
            <li>Added "Start Delay" as a statistic to the "Race of Competitor" data mining category.</li>
         </ul>
         <h5 class="articleSubheadline">January 2025</h5>
         <ul class="bulletList">
            <li>Export of Polar data as CSV has been fixed now in Data Mining.</li>
            <li>The link format for <tt>/gwt/Home.html</tt> has changed. We're now using a Base64-encoded version
                of the regatta name instead of the URL-encoded regatta name. We're trying to remain backward-compatible
                by assuming that if you're link doesn't parse as a Base64-encoded regatta name, it may have been the
                simply URL-encoded regatta name; so except for very strange corner cases, you're old links and
                bookmarks should still work.</li>
            <li>We introduced two new metrics for tail color and competitor chart: Change of Gap, and Change of Gap to Leader.
                These represent an average of the respective gap value change over the last approximately five position fixes,
                e.g., 5s for a 1Hz sampling rate.</li>
            <li>When using tail colors to visualize metrics, so far we spread the value range across the colors available
                in a "linear" way. This made outliers and maneuvers waste a lot of the color space. Instead, for all
                metrics except  over ground (COG) we now use a cubic root function that reserves most of
                the available color space to the values in the middle of the range to be visualized, whereas
                the values closer to the boundaries of the range are assigned less space of the color range.
                See how the color key displayed at the top of the map changed.</li>
            <li>Introduced a new metric for visualization in the competitor chart and as a tail color: percent
                target boat speed. This is computed from the polar data and the local wind conditions (TWS, TWA)
                at the position of the competitor at the given time point.</li>
            <li>Hovering over a colored tail on the map where the color represents a detail value as selected by the user,
                the tool tip that pops up will now display the detail value at the point over which the mouse pointer
                is hovering.</li>
            <li>Another fix to the polar data CSV export from the Data Mining module; the ";" separators were missing
                for the negative (port tack) angles.</li>
         </ul>
         <h5 class="articleSubheadline">December 2024</h5>
         <ul class="bulletList">
            <li>Polar data in Data Mining can now be filtered and grouped by sailor profiles.</li>
            <li>Added a new REST API method: <tt>/api/v1/regattas/{regattaname}/races/{racename}/competitordata</tt>
                for requesting time series of values for one or more parameters such as rank or distance, for one or more competitors.
                See <a href="/sailingserver/webservices/api/v1/raceDetailsGetCompetitorData.html">here</a> for more details on what it does.</li>
            <li>Bug Fix: Accidentally, when hardening the data mining security, Competitor entities were only processed anymore if
                the user had <tt>READ</tt> and not only <tt>READ_PUBLIC</tt> permission, often leading to empty results.
                The bug had been introduced late November 2024. Apologies to all data mining users.</li>
         </ul>
         <h5 class="articleSubheadline">November 2024</h5>
         <ul class="bulletList">
            <li>Added a data mining dimension "tenth of leg" for competitor position fixes, such that, e.g.,
                the first or last tenth of a leg (based on the windward distance) can be excluded during
                data collection.</li>
            <li>Introduced an extended data mining retriever chain that allows users to drill into ten
                equal-duration sub-slices of each leg to, e.g., compare average performance across different
                parts of legs.</li>
            <li>Added metrics for a "relative" cross-track error (XTE) in the data mining environment, both,
                signed and unsigned. To allow for a comparison of XTE values across legs of different lengths,
                the distances from the course middle line are divided by half the leg's length at that point
                in time. This way, e.g., a position on one far side of an upwind leg after having sailed half
                the leg, in a boat class that has approximately a 90° tacking angle would result in a value
                close to <tt>(+/-) 1.0</tt>, regardless the length of the leg.</li>
            <li>Added cross-track error (XTE) metrics that don't project onto the course middle line ("rhumb line",
                although instead of the "rhumb line" (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhumb_line">the Wikipedia definition</a>)
                we use a great circle segment connecting the leg's waypoints), but onto the wind vector attached to the
                leg's end waypoint (e.g., the windward mark for an upwind leg). The metrics are again
                available in signed/unsigned as well as in absolute and relative (to half the leg distance)
                variants.</li>
            <li>Introduced a new Data Mining dimension "Sailor Profile Name." With this, if a user in their "User Details"
                creates one or more "Sailor Profiles" to group multiple occurrences of what is to be considered "the same sailor"
                into one profile, these profiles can be used for filtering and grouping in data mining.</li>
            <li>Bug fix: data mining now correctly propagates the current user session to all data retrieval processes,
                and all security checks for object readability by the current subject are now in place.</li>
            <li>User e-mail and password changes were not always updated properly to the persistent storage
                and may have gotten reset, e.g., during a software update. This is now fixed.</li>
         </ul>
         <h5 class="articleSubheadline">October 2024</h5>
         <ul class="bulletList">
            <li>Bug fix: for match racing tie breaks, under very special circumstances the tie breaking
                algorithm (based on a topological ordering based on wins/losses) could have run into an
                endless loop.</li>
         </ul>
         <h5 class="articleSubheadline">August 2024</h5>
         <ul class="bulletList">
            <li>Extended simulator timeouts to avoid failing to compute a path with "out-of-bounds"in
                more situations and under high load scenarios.</li>
            <li>No more tool tips for course area circles. They kept tool tips for lines (such as start/finish
                lines or course middle lines) from showing when hovering the mouse over them.</li>
            <li>In Data Mining, race results now have a new dimension "Discarded" for grouping and filtering.</li>
            <li>Races of competitors now have a new statistic in Data Mining: duration since start to first tack.</li>
            <li>New data mining dimension for races: type of first leg. This way, races can be filtered or results can
                be grouped by whether a race's first leg is an upwind, reaching or downwind leg.</li>
         </ul>
         <h5 class="articleSubheadline">July 2024</h5>
         <ul class="bulletList">
            <li>Fixed a problem with the REST API, asked for maneuvers when a leg hasn't started yet.</li>
            <li>Simulator overlay now remembers path selection across updates.</li>
            <li>Adjusted Formula Kite dimensions.</li>
         </ul>
         <h5 class="articleSubheadline">June 2024</h5>
         <ul class="bulletList">
            <li>Added the <tt>timepoint-ms</tt> and <tt>lastScoringUpdate-ms</tt> fields to the
                <tt>/sailingserver/api/v1/leaderboardgroups/{id|name}</tt>
                response which reports the time point as the number of milliseconds since the epoch (1970-01-01T00:00:00Z, "Unix time").
                The <tt>timepoint</tt> and <tt>lastScoringUpdate</tt> fields' format is not easily machine-readable,
                but we're not changing the format for reasons of backward compatibility.</li>
            <li>The REST API for <tt>/sailingserver/api/v1/events/{event-id}</tt> and <tt>/sailingserver/api/v1/leaderboardgroups/{leaderboardgroup-name-or-id}</tt>
                now have the new <tt>overallLeaderboardName</tt> field for the leaderboard group(s), and the latter now also has
                the <tt>hasOverallLeaderboard</tt> Boolean field. The <tt>overallLeaderboardName</tt> field is present if and only if
                <tt>hasOverallLeaderboard</tt> is <tt>true</tt>.</li>
            <li>Boat visualization for OK Dinghy for downwind legs now without spinnaker.</li>
            <li>Boat visualization for RS Tera for downwind legs now without spinnaker.</li>
         </ul>
         <h5 class="articleSubheadline">April 2024</h5>
         <ul class="bulletList">
            <li>Added the <tt>trueheading-deg</tt> field to the competitor GPS fix export if the tracker has provided it.</li>
         </ul>
         <h5 class="articleSubheadline">March 2024</h5>
         <ul class="bulletList">
            <li>Bug fix: when collapsing the leaderboard while a few competitor info flags are already
                showing on the map, speeds were not updated properly anymore. This is now fixed.</li>
            <li>Bug fix: when the last score update date/time was displayed with the user being in a non-UTC
                time zone, date and time were formatted using different time zones (time: UTC; date: local time zone).
                This may have led to inconsistent displays.</li>
            <li>Bug fix: the new drop-down race choose in the Race Board failed to work if the race from which it
                was used does not have a valid start time yet.</li>
            <li>In case of an unbreakable tie, instead of always using the competitor name to arrive at some stable
                sorting, now we use the sail number in case boats cannot change during the regatta (as they could in,
                say, a league format). This makes sorting more consistent with regatta management systems such
                as Manage2Sail.</li>
            <li>Added "AIN" as pseudo country code.</li>
            <li>Default sorting order, based on sail number, now uses "natural ordering" which means that the
                numerical part of a sail number is sorted by numerical value.</li>
         </ul>
         <h5 class="articleSubheadline">February 2024</h5>
         <ul class="bulletList">
            <li>Fixed an issue for users with event update rights that resulted in them being
                unable to see the media tab of single regatta events for events without
                pre-existing media objects.</li>
            <li>When connectors support providing a heading (magnetic as in HDG, or true as
                in HDT), the heading will be used for the boat orientation on the map. The
                TracTrac connector, starting with its version 3.15.2, does support this if
                the trackers in use provide a true heading value.</li>
            <li>The "classic" <tt>/gwt/Spectator.html</tt> entry point now renders races also as
                clickable if they do not have any valid wind readings.</li>
            <li>Fixed non responsive sizing of the carousel header in home.html.</li>
         </ul>
         <h5 class="articleSubheadline">January 2024</h5>
         <ul class="bulletList">
            <li>The header bar on the home / landing page now consumes the full window width.
                This way, the drop-down menu for additional menu options needs to be displayed
                less often, as on wide-enough screens all options easily fit into the header
                bar.</li>
            <li>Bug fix for colored tails: maximum value for color key was sometimes not
                adjusted properly, leading to a "red shift" on the tails.</li>
            <li>The race name display in the header bar of the race viewer ("RaceBoard") is
                now a clickable drop-down menu that allows users to easily navigate to other
                races of the same regatta.</li>
            <li>The advantage line, if shown, now extends across the entire size of the map,
                regardless the zoom level.</li>
            <li>Event base URLs with trailing slashes no longer produce incorrect race viewer
                URLs in the REST API. Furthermore, race and regatta names will now be properly
                URL-encoded when constructing a race viewer URL.</li>
            <li>Avoid full-circle rotation of start/finish boat display when rotation oscillates
                around 0deg.</li>
         </ul>
         <h5 class="articleSubheadline">December 2023</h5>
         <ul class="bulletList">
            <li>The memory manager for data mining queries is now less aggressive for large heap sizes and
                therefore less likely to kill expensive queries when there is still enough free memory.</li>
            <li>Added two dimensions on wind fix datamining ("is in race" and "is in tracking time range").</li>
            <li>Added a simple data mining retriever chain allowing for competitor counting.</li>
            <li>Added a statistic for smoothed speed on GPS fixes in data mining.</li>
            <li>Issues with updating the boat tails on the map have been resolved.</li>

                a tracked race is already attached for the dependent race, resolving the dependent start time
                while still reading the data from the primary instance fails and is erroneously cached. Now,
                instead, a new attempt to resolve the race on which the other's start time depends, will be
                made, then finding the race log searched for. This will fix the issue of unreliable

           <li>The mark passing / split times detection has been adjusted for overall improved
               accuracy of most tracking devices. This will in particular reduce the tolerance
               for passing a mark on the wrong side, hence more likely suppressing passing candidates
               on the wrong side of a mark even if the passing happened very near to the mark.</li>
           <li>Bug fix: tracked races connected to more than one leaderboard column at the same time
               will now send their competitor and race status updates to all those column's race logs.
               This in particular fixes the special iQFOil set-up with their marathon races.</li>
           <li>Added speed in full knots (rounded) as a dimension to the GPS fixes in Data Mining.
               This can be used, e.g., to filter for outliers such as capsized or towed boats.</li>

               optional incremental score corrections which are added to the points determined based on the competitor's rank

               points may now be specified which applied during tracking the race. Absolute score corrections will be considered
               for these IRMs at the end of the race, regardless the incremental score correction. Note that the increments
               are subject to any column factors being applied; this may contradict an event's rules that may state that certain
               penalties, such as <tt>STP</tt> are <em>not</em> subject to doubling for a medal race. In such cases, specify half

               The boat classes internally continue using their original names, also

            <li>An STP or SCP scoring code ("Standard Penalty" / "Scoring Penalty") now by default adds 1.0 to the competitor's score as calculated based on the ranking.
                The STP / SCP code is shown already with the beginning of the race, but any official scoring result entered after the race will be
                used during replay only once the competitor has finished the race. For the medal stages of the new Formula Kite scoring
                (Low Point, First to Win Three Races, both, the A8.1 and A8.2 variants) an STP / SCP will add 1.1 to the competitor's score.</li>
            <li>The "Low Point, First to Win Three Races" scoring schemes, which rank competitors in the medal series based on the number of
                "races won" now count a win if the competitor has achieved the lowest score in that race. This changes the previous rule where
                the competitor needed to score 1.0 points in order to be called the "winner" of that race. In particular, with this change
                a competitor with, say, 2.0 points can be the "winner" of the race in case the competitor finishing first took a standard
                penalty (STP) or scoring penalty (SCP) which adds 1.1 points to the 1.0 point awarded for finishing first, so a total of 2.1 points, thus worse
                than the 2.0 points of the competitor finishing second. Should there still be a tie on points, the finishing order is
                used to break that tie.</li>

           <li>The <a href="/gwt/DataMining.html">Data Mining module</a> now supports combining several queries
               displayed in the well-known multi-tab view at the bottom into a "report" that can also have
               "parameters." For example, you can bind the regatta selection of the various queries you run
               to a single "Regatta" parameter by using the new "P" button. This will synchronize your
               filter selection across those queries. Like queries, reports can be saved and loaded using a
               report name. The parameter settings are stored together with the report. If after loading
               you change, e.g., the regatta selection that was bound to a parameter, the selection changes
               for all your queries in the report. Running them again after switching to their results tab
               will get you the synchronized results.</li>
           <li>Bug fix: sometimes, when removing a dimension from the grouping instructions in DataMining,
               remnants of the previous grouping structure could have remained when running the new query

               the leading boat. It scales such that one spoke is a power of ten meters (10m, 100m, 1000m, ...).
               When panning and zooming you may notice a slight jitter, depending on your browser and

           <li>The place for which the "combined wind" is calculated is now closer to the "middle of the course" than
               before. Before, each waypoint's position was considered for the average, overemphasizing leeward waypoints
               for windward-leeward courses, for example. Now, each leg's middle position is considered for the average,
               with a weight that corresponds to the leg's length. This results in an average that virtually takes into
               account every single point on each sailed leg's rhumb line. Note, though, that the positions are taken based
               on the mark positions at the time point requested. If marks are moved around the course this will have an
               effect, obviously, on how this average is calculated.</li>

           <li>Dampening of wind, in particular the estimation from courses over ground (COG),
               has been improved. The confidences inferred from cluster sizes sailing on separate tacks
               are now growing more smoothly for small fleet sizes and hence cause less unexpected
               "jumps" in estimated wind directions. Base confidence of wind estimations, compared

            <li>A new wind source that estimates true wind direction and speed from maneuvers is available.
                It has been trained using machine learning techniques, based on approximately 12 million
                maneuvers that the SAP Sailing Analytics have tracked and classified so far. It is intended
                to serve as a fallback wind source in case the wind direction is not being made available
                to a tracked race in any other way (entry through the Race Manager app, the web page or
                estimated based on the first upwind leg's direction). Therefore, the confidence level has
                been set fairly low, hence this wind source will always be outweighed by any real wind
                sensor out on the course, but it will help "bootstrap" true wind direction which then
                also helps the already existing wind direction estimation that clusters the tracks of
                a race into upwind and downwind, then by the tacks the boats are on and then averages
                the COG values to obtain a TWD approximation. With the new maneuver-based wind source

                     the query finishes. The result will be displayed in the tab that was selected when the execution
                     started.</li>
                  <li>The tabs now remember the query that has been used to calculate the currently displayed
                     result. The query of a tab is displayed when the tab is selected.</li>
                  <li>A setting has been added to prevent that changes are lost, when a different query should be
                     displayed. The default setting is to ask, if the changes should be discarded or kept (preventing
                     that the query is displayed).</li>
                  <li>The suggested statistics are now grouped by their retriever chain</li>
                  <li>The aggregator and statistic control switched places and are now linked together. This means that
                     all aggregators/statistics can always be selected, but are grayed out if one component isn't supported
                     by the other (e.g. an aggregator doesn't exist for the currently selected statistic). The other
                     component will be reset when an unsupported component is selected.</li>
                  <li>Counting aggregators now work directly on the retrieved data elements and don't require the
                     selection of a specific statistic. Changing to a counting aggregator when a statistic is selected
                     automatically changes it to the corresponding data type.</li>
                  <li>The filter selection and dimensions to group by are now retained (where possible), if the statistic
                     is changed to one that is based on a different data type.</li>
               </ul>

            <li>Issues with sporadic incorrect zoom/pan states in the Race Board / race viewer have been fixed.</li>
            <li>Fixed an issue with the "Winning Lanes" mode for large races that could lead to full tails for all

                     retriever level names can be used to filter the dimension list.</li>
                  <li>Selecting a filter dimension adds a table containing the available values of the selected

            <li>In the raceboard a new maneuver table has been added next to the wind and competitor charts. It
               shows the detected maneuvers of selected competitors which can be filtered by type via the respective
               settings dialog. Also, the table entries can be sorted by clicking the column headers. During replay of
               finished races, clicking a maneuver will skip to the beginning of the maneuver. In case of a live race,
               the maneuver table will progressively fill with more data, as it becomes available.</li>
            <li>The size of the start count down shown near the start line on the map can now be adjusted in the
               map settings.</li>
            <li>The advantage line is now displayed in orange color which makes it easier to see on blue water.</li>
            <li>A problem with the mark passing calculation for smart phone-tracked races has been solved. This

            <li>The language preference set in the user profile (if any), now also affects the website's language.
               Formerly, this preference affected the language of notification mails only. Be aware of the fact, that
               signing in will not force the page to be shown in the user's preferred language. It will only take effect
               when refreshing the page manually or opening a new one, in order to prevent the state of the currently
               opened page to get lost. After a sign out (and another page reload) the language preference will stop to
               take effect.</li>
            <li>There are additional column types in the leaderboard that show per leg, per race and overall
               statistics for distance foiled and duration foiled. This allows for quick competitor comparisons
               regarding these figures which are so important for any foiling boat class. Note, that this feature is
               also available on overall leaderboards, providing foiling stats across an entire season or event series.

            <li>When a leaderboard belongs to a leaderboard group with an overall (series) leaderboard and the
               leaderboard has no scores at all yet for a competitor, that competitor won't be assigned a score in the
               overall (series) leaderboard either. This way, when an act or event has its leaderboard already linked to
               the series leaderboard group, no scores will show in the series leaderboard before the act/event starts
               producing scores for the competitors.</li>

            <li>The <tt>DataMining.html</tt> module now reacts on clicks on bars in the result chart and triggers a
               corresponding drill-down operation, adding the first grouping key value as a new filter and removing the
               grouping dimension. If that was the last dimension removed, the user is asked to provide a new grouping

               are detected based on the total number of tracked races known (races having GPS data and a valid start
               date). Anniversary types currently known are round quarters like 10'000, 25'000, and 50'000 as well as
               numbers where all digits are the same like 11'111 or 22'222. Some time before such a milestone is
               reached, a countdown is shown on the start page. When an anniversary is reached, the determined race is
               shown at the same place.</li>

               you need to expand the list of events for that year.</li>
            <li>The simulation overlay is now also available prior to the start of a live race. It can therefore,
               e.g., be used to "predict" the best course on the first upwind leg based on the latest wind measurements.

               Position Editor. It will require removing and re-tracking the race to make the removal take effect.</li>
            <li>In <code>/gwt/RaceBoard.html</code> it's now possible to display an overlay that shows the
               estimated duration based on the course and the current wind conditions. To show this information, you
               need to select the respective option in the map's settings dialog. The option's visibility depends on the
               availability of sufficient polar data for the boat class.

                  <li>Document settings are saved as delta to the user defaults instead of the delta to the system
                     defaults. In cases where a setting has the value 'A' as system default and 'B' as user default,
                     it's now possible to set it back to 'A' for a document. Settings stored before this change will
                     continue to work with the old overwriting semantic.</li>
                  <li>Collection based settings are now stored as delta to the default set of values. This means
                     that removals and additions are being recorded instead of all values of a setting. Having value 'A'
                     as system default and adding 'B' for the user default and 'C' for one document will select values
                     'A', 'B' and 'C' for the document.</li>
                  <li>Settings dialogs now have a 'reset to default' button. When pressing this button, user
                     defaults as well as the current document settings are being reset to the system defaults. In
                     addition, the settings dialog is updated to show the system defaults. Those defaults will only take
                     effect for the current view when pressing ok.</li>
                  <li>User settings can now also be saved for <code>/gwt/RaceBoard.html</code>. Be aware that
                     different modes have distinct settings so that defaults defined for one mode do not have any effect
                     on other modes.
                  </li>
                  <li>On the user profile page you can now find a list of all stored settings. You can show the
                     technical settings data and remove specific setting entries.</li>

            <li>It's now possible to show nationality flags in addition to competitor images in leaderboards if
               both are available. If no competitor images are available, this won't have any effect. You can activate
               this option through the leaderboard settings dialog to be found in various views.</li>

         <h5 class="articleSubheadline">April 2017</h5>
         <ul class="bulletList">
            <li>Several pages are now enabled to save user settings with the following specifics:
               <ul>
                  <li>In settings dialogs there is a "Make default" button in the lower-left corner which is
                     displayed when saving of settings is enabled. A click on that button causes the system to use the
                     new settings as default values for the same page. This is independent of a race, event or
                     leaderboard to be shown.</li>
                  <li>A click on OK button causes the system to store the settings as document settings. Document
                     settings are only used for the same event, leaderboard or race. When the page is opened for e.g.
                     the same race, the settings used last time are loaded.</li>
                  <li>Settings saved this way are stored locally in the browser's local storage and in the user
                     profile if you are logged in.</li>
                  <li>Settings can be overwritten by URL parameters.</li>

                  <li>Leaderboards embedded in <code>/gwt/Home.html</code></li>

               work slightly different.
            </li>
            <li>The maneuver loss calculation for penalty circles has been improved. Previously, the end of the
               penalty circle maneuver was considered to be at the last of the two adjacent tack/gybe maneuvers. This,
               usually, is earlier than when approaching the course over ground at the beginning of the penalty circle
               again. With this, the extrapolation of the speed/course at the beginning of the maneuver did not last
               long enough. Furthermore, penalties with strong accelerations during the gybing phase could have led to
               an incorrect inference of the speed and course at the beginning of the maneuver. Both of these issues
               have now been fixed, leading to good results also in very specific and unusual speed developments during
               a penalty circle maneuver.</li>
            <li>The advantage line display has been fixed for legs changing their type (upwind/downwind/reach)
               while the race is going on. It now uses the leg type at the same current time point that the leaderboard
               uses for calculating the competitor ranking.</li>
            <li>Images in the overall image gallery ("Photographers love Sailing") are now linked with the events
               to which they belong. Clicking the image navigates to the event page.</li>

               set your preferred language.</li>
            <li>The application's locale now switches based on the client's "Accept-Language" HTTP header field.

               height calculated by the sensor we are now showing the minimum of the port and starboard ride heights.
               Therefore, this new definition of ride height can be seen as the distance of lowest hull part from the

            <li>An issue with live re-calculation of the maximum speed over ground (SOG) values has been fixed. In
               some circumstances it was possible that new live data did not properly update the MaxSOG figures. Since
               this depended on the timing of read and write access it could have led to different values for different
               server instances, giving confusing results. The fix provided now ensures that the MaxSOG values are
               properly evaluated when new data has arrived.</li>
            <li>The buoy zone radius is now determined by a configurable regatta property. By default, it is set to
               two hull lengths, and a regatta administrator may choose to change it to any other factor such as 3 or
               2.5. This determines the default used in the race viewer (RaceBoard.html). Users can still change the
               radius in the map settings to any arbitrary number, deviating from what has "officially" been set for the

            <li>In order to prepare user-specific configuration support in additional parts of the application,
               various modules now require a user account to be accessed. Please sign up and log in to use their full
               functionality as usual. The following modules are affected:

            <li>The Wind arrow in the top left corner of the race map / player now serves as a toggle button for
               the wind streamlet overlay which can still also be reached through the map settings.</li>
            <li>If you want to analyze a race, the navigation slightly changed. The button, which is shown for
               tracked races won't lead you to the race board directly, but provides a small menu. There you can choose
               from several pre-defined analysis, which will launch the race board with respective configurations:
               <ul>
                  <li>Replay/Watch live: Launches race board in play mode starting at race start, if race is
                     already finished (Replay) or at the actual time, if the race is currently live (Watch live)</li>
                  <li>Race analysis: Shows the race results by setting the timer to the end of the race. <i>This
                        option is only available, if the race is already finished.</i>
                  </li>
                  <li>Start analysis: Shows the race start 10 sec after start and shows the speed over ground (SOG)
                     of the best starters within the competitor chart (zoomed to start). <i>This option is only
                        available, if the race is already started.</i>
                  </li>
                  <li>Winning lanes: Shows the full lanes of the best competitor, if race is already finished or
                     the of leading competitors if the race is currently live.</li>
               </ul>
            </li>
            <li>On the user profile page you now can maintain a list of you favorite boat classes and competitors.
               You can also opt in for notification mails about your favorites to stay informed. A requirement for
               notification mails to work for you is that you entered a valid mail address to your user profile and
               verified the address by clicking the link that has been sent via email.</li>
            <li>Users now may choose their preferred language on the user profile page. Currently only the mail
               notification mechanism will accept this setting to send mails in the preferred language. This also
               prepares additional language sensitive feature, e.g. automatically switching the website to your
               preferred language when logged in.</li>
            <li>The leaderboard now has a new measure value called "Ride height", which shows the ride height on
               foils of a competitor, if respective data is available (currently ESS only). This information can also be
               shown in the competitor chart on the RaceBaord page.</li>
            <li>To visualize multiple information at once, the competitor chart on the RaceBaord page can now be
               configured to show two Y-axes.</li>
         </ul>

         <h5 class="articleSubheadline">May 2016</h5>
         <ul class="bulletList">
            <li>It is now possible to follow races on the RaceBoard, even if there's no wind data available.</li>

         <h5 class="articleSubheadline">April 2016</h5>
         <ul class="bulletList">
            <li>The <tt>/gwt/RaceBoard.html</tt> entry point now accepts an optional parameter "t" in the form <tt>[[hh:]mm:]ss</tt>,
               for example <tt>t=12:34</tt> to place the timer so much after the race start if the viewer comes up in
               Replay mode. You may also use just seconds, as in <tt>t=1234</tt> which makes specifying a time <em>before</em>
               the start somewhat easier (<tt>t=-123</tt> instead of <tt>t=-02:-03</tt>).

         <h5 class="articleSubheadline">February 2016</h5>
         <ul class="bulletList">
            <li>The website now features a user registration and authentication interface. User accounts are
               currently used to grant special permissions to administrators and moderators. New user specific features
               (e.g. preferences) will be available in the next couple of months.</li>
            <li>The RaceBoard URL Parameter "canReplayDuringLiveRaces" has been removed. This parameter was used to
               allow users to trigger autoplay for live races on non-live points in time. The permission
               "CAN_REPLAY_DURING_LIVE_RACES" and role "moderator" now grant this functionality to users.</li>
            <li>Mark positions are no longer interpolated between fixes. Instead, when a mark's track is asked for
               the mark's position, the last known position at or before the time point requested will be used. The
               "jumping" of marks in the UI that may otherwise be caused by this is ameliorated by introducing the same
               CSS animation for the marks that is already used for the boats.</li>
         </ul>

         <h5 class="articleSubheadline">January 2016</h5>
         <ul class="bulletList">
            <li>Show maneuver markers on the race board by default (tacks, jibes and penalty circles) with a
               smaller icon, which shows an info bubble when the marker is clicked. The icon turns green if the
               direction change is to starboard and red if to port.</li>
         </ul>

         <h5 class="articleSubheadline">December 2015</h5>
         <ul class="bulletList">
            <li>The advantage line is now animated and moves smoothly with the boats.</li>
            <li>New line hover behavior in race map. When the mouse is moved onto a line, for example the start
               line, a transparent, wider line is activated behind it that acts as a buffer for the thin line, where the
               text displayed by the hover is still shown. This makes it easier to hover over the lines. These wider
               lines can be made semi transparent instead of transparent by unticking the corresponding checkbox in the
               settings of the race map. Furthermore the stroke weight of the wider lines can be configured in the same
               settings dialog.</li>
            <li>The race viewer (RaceBoard.html) now intelligently chooses a layout that suits the screen size.
               When only little horizontal space is available, only the sail number and nationality but not the
               competitor's long name is displayed by default. When vertical space is scarce, competitor and wind charts
               are disabled and more horizontal space can be given to the time slider at the bottom. The leaderboard
               section can then be scaled to smaller widths and will reduce the column widths better than in the past.</li>
            <li>With the changes described above, the RaceBoard is now also accessible from the races page on
               mobile devices.</li>
            <li>For overall / series leaderboards such as a national sailing league or the Extreme Sailing Series,
               the live status of the overall leaderboard is now indicated. As long as a live race is ongoing, the
               respective column in the overall leaderboard is highlighted, and a comment is displayed that indicates
               which regatta is currently still live.</li>

         <h5 class="articleSubheadline">November 2015</h5>

         <ul class="bulletList">
            <li>The smartphone page provides some structural navigation items for several pages in the upper right
               burger menu. You will see links to e.g. events, regattas and series when navigating on event and series
               pages.</li>
            <li>It is now possible to filter for competitors in the race list of events/regattas. If competitor
               information is available, there is a filter box in the upper right corner of the races page. The filter
               is searching for competitors by sail ID as well as the competitor's name.</li>
            <li>Regattas can now be filtered by boat category in the smartphone page. The filter will be shown for
               events with multiple regattas if there is more than on boat category associated with the event.</li>
         </ul>

         <h5 class="articleSubheadline">October 2015</h5>

         <ul class="bulletList">
            <li>A variety of tablets will now show the desktop page by default. The mobile version of the website
               is primarily designed to be used on smartphones, but you can manually switch back to the mobile version
               by clicking the corresponding link in the page footer.</li>
            <li>There is some amount of caching on the web page to reduce the consumed traffic for mobile users.
               Contents aren't loaded again on each page switch. This improves the traffic consumption and loading speed
               on fast page switches.</li>
            <li>The fullscreen image viewer (start page and event media page) can automatically slide through the
               images. This can be turned on by clicking the corresponding icon in the upper right corner of the
               fullscreen viewer.</li>
            <li>There is an optimized search and results page for mobile devices now.</li>
         </ul>

         <h5 class="articleSubheadline">September 2015</h5>

         <ul class="bulletList">
            <li>Races in the event/regatta race list can now be shown in 'competition format'. In this format the
               races and flights are shown in a structural view. In contrast to the default list view there is no
               grouping by live and finished states and all (including upcoming) races/flights are shown in one
               structural view.</li>
            <li>The mobile page now provides regatta overview pages for events having multiple regattas. This page
               shows live races, an excerpt of the current results as well as statistics for the regatta.</li>
         </ul>

         <h5 class="articleSubheadline">August 2015</h5>

         <ul class="bulletList">
            <li>Series events appear as only one entry in the events list, with a marker that this is only one of a
               certain number of events in a series. This way, the many series events don't produce clutter in the
               events list.</li>
            <li>Bug fix: memory leaks for distance cache have been solved. The issue could also lead to endless
               recursions, ultimately leading to server lock-ups.</li>
            <li>Bug fix: master data import detached race logs and regatta logs from database. Log entries added
               after import on the importing server were not written to the database and therefore were lost upon server
               restart.</li>
            <li>There is a smartphone-optimized version of the "solutions" page known from the desktop.</li>
            <li>The smartphone event history now has a slider that allows swiping through the events of a year.</li>
         </ul>

         <h5 class="articleSubheadline">July 2015</h5>

         <ul class="bulletList">
            <li>Major improvements to the web page, with specific enhancements for smartphone users. Race lists are
               now sortable by various criteria by clicking on the column headers. A new fancy progress indicator now
               also provides visual feedback for multi-fleet regattas. A news ticker box has been implemented, and the
               event overview page can hold a video player on its stage. The event media gallery section has been
               greatly improved.</li>
            <li>Fixed a bug in the wind streamlet visualization. Now the wind streamlets correctly show the wind at
               the location selected also in wind-up mode.</li>
            <li>Added the "Course Geometry" option to the map display. With this option selected, the map will show
               an info text for each leg and the start and finish line (only for one of start/finish line if they are
               identical), telling the length of the leg or line, respectively, and its angle to the wind. For the start
               and finish line the advantage of the favored side is shown in meters.</li>
            <li>The SAP Sailing Analytics start page is now available in the smartphone version. This page features
               some events that are currently interesting as well as showing a quickfinder for a variety of recent and
               upcoming events. Previously, the start page redirected to the event history.</li>
         </ul>

         <h5 class="articleSubheadline">May 2015</h5>

         <ul class="bulletList">
            <li>Competitors can have a separate flag image, such as a club flag to be displayed instead of the
               nationality flag usually displayed with the sail number. This enables national league events to display
               the club flags consistently when all nation flags would be the same anyway.</li>
            <li>The wind estimation from the tracked courses over ground has been improved. It now takes into
               account any polar data available for the boat class concerned. In particular, this helps to rule out very
               unlikely gybing angles in downwind clusters that otherwise could have led to an incorrect split of the
               downwind fleet into two clusters where actually all boats were on the same tack.</li>
            <li>Some significant improvements have been applied to the simulator feature which is embedded in the
               race viewer since some time now. The simulator now copes with very shifty wind conditions and finds
               solutions in scenarios where an upwind leg flips to a reach or even into a downwind leg over time.</li>
         </ul>

         <h5 class="articleSubheadline">April 2015</h5>

         <ul class="bulletList">
            <li>There is a new map setting "Wind-Up (show wind from top of map)". Selecting it will align the map's
               top with the combined true wind average direction around the time currently selected in the time slider.
               In this new view there are limitations as to how far you can zoom out. Furthermore, you will not be able
               to use the Satellite view with this setting. Tip: if you want to re-align to wind-up after a major wind
               shift, un-check the setting, confirm the setting change, then set it again. A compass shows the true
               north orientation. Clicking the compass will toggle between wind-up and north-up display.</li>
            <li>Bug fixes around addition of the "Regatta Rank" column in the leaderboard which could have
               distorted the leaderboard's column layout under certain conditions.</li>
            <li>Bug fix for cumulative points in the leaderboard ("Show added scores for each entry in
               leaderboard"). With this setting, scores of competitors not tracked in the current race were not
               correctly represented and may have stayed blank.</li>
            <li>Bug fix for the leg counter in the regatta page: when the first boat has finished, the leg counter
               went to zero (e.g., "0 of 8"). This has now been fixed, and it will show, e.g., "8 of 8" upon the first
               boat crossing the finish line.</li>
         </ul>

         <h5 class="articleSubheadline">March 2015</h5>

         <ul class="bulletList">
            <li>Added competitor chart type for Course Over Ground (COG)</li>
            <li>Added leaderboard column and competitor chart entry for distances considering gate starts. With
               gate starts, late starters sail a shorter distance in their first leg. To still make distances
               comparable, a new metric has been introduced that for a gate start adds the distance between the port
               side of the start line and the position where the competitor started to the distance sailed in the first
               leg.</li>
            <li>The weights of the wind measurement units, the wind estimation and manual wind inputs by the race
               committee are now used properly for the wind streamlet visualization. This fixes issues with exaggerated
               weights for an estimated wind direction of very low confidence.</li>
            <li>The expand/collapse toggle button in the race viewer's time panel has correct arrows now.</li>
         </ul>

         <h5 class="articleSubheadline">February 2015</h5>

         <ul class="bulletList">
            <li>The leaderboard offers a new column: "Start delay." It shows the number of seconds that passed
               since the race start and the time the competitor passes the start mark / start line. As usual, you can
               sort for this column. For line starts, this is a fairly direct measure of start quality except for port
               starts which may have to be considered differently. For gate starts, you can use this measure to find out
               about early and late starters and dig into possible correlations between results and start time point.</li>
         </ul>

         <h5 class="articleSubheadline">January 2015</h5>

         <ul class="bulletList">
            <li>The race viewer ("RaceBoard.html") now offers a new option in the map settings: "Show simulation
               overlay". Checking this feature will simulate the current leader's leg using different strategies and
               using the wind as it has been measured and estimated. This feature becomes particularly interesting when
               combined with the "Show wind streamlets overlay" feature that visualizes the spatial distribution of the
               wind field over the course.</li>
            <li>The race viewer is now more resilient against exceptional conditions such as the missing of all
               wind information and the missing of a course with its waypoints. If no wind information is available at
               all (no wind direction indicator is then shown in the upper left corner of the map) then all ranking and
               distances will be based on a projection onto the course instead of onto the wind direction, even for
               upwind and downwind legs.</li>
         </ul>

         <h5 class="articleSubheadline">September 2014</h5>

         <ul class="bulletList">
            <li>The search feature now also includes results from currently ongoing events that may not yet be
               included in our archive. Search keywords are now properly used in constructing the query.</li>
         </ul>

         <h5 class="articleSubheadline">August 2014</h5>

         <ul class="bulletList">
            <li>The 2D race viewer, also known as the "Race Board," now comes with a fresh, new design. The orange
               checkbox toggle buttons that open or close views such as the leaderboard or the charts for wind and
               competitor comparison, have been replaced by tabs with "&gt;&gt;" symbols. Clicking on those will expand
               or collapse the respective view. The views can now be resized using the handles attached to the dividers
               separating the views. They work much better on mobile and touch devices than the splitters used
               previously did. The settings buttons that used to be integrated with the orange toggle checkbox buttons
               have now been moved into the views that they control. For example, the map settings button is now
               displayed on the map, below the zoom control on the right map border.</li>
            <li>The leaderboard now has an improved search and filter control. Above the table displaying the
               competitors and their figures is a new field with a text input that you can use to filter for
               competitors, by their sail number or their name. While filtered, use the checkboxes in front of the table
               row to add the competitor to or remove it from the selection. Use the "X" button to the right of the
               search input field to clear the search. To the left of the search input field is a filter symbol that you
               can use to select and create advanced filtering rules, such as filtering by rank or nationality. Left of
               the filter button is the leaderboard settings button.</li>
            <li>The leaderboard has a new first column: a selection check box. We hope this makes it easier in
               particular for users on mobile or other touch devices to select more than one competitor at a time. The
               old-style multi-selection using the Control and Shift keys, as known well from typical desktop file
               explorers, still work like they did before. Note that it is possible to sort for the checkbox column,
               putting the selected competitors at the top of the leaderboard.</li>
            <li>When using the auto-zoom feature from the map settings, boats and wind streamlets will now continue
               to move smoothly as long as the map only needs panning. Please also note that auto-zooming to "tails" may
               slow down the display considerable, particularly when tracking at high frequency.</li>
            <li>When viewing a single race, the leaderboard now by default does no longer show the regatta rank as
               the first column (and not as the second one either, given that the first column now usually shows the
               checkboxes used for selecting items). If you'd like to get the regatta rank column back, also when
               looking at a single race, please choose it from the leaderboard settings dialog where you can find it in
               the "Overall Details" section. It may still be a nice column to have when following the last race in a
               regatta. If you're just interested in the relative regatta rank ordering you may as well sort by the
               right-most total points column which (surprising to some but welcome by most) sorts by the regatta rank
               and not by the plain points sum (taking into account medal race and gold/silver/... fleet
               participations).</li>
         </ul>

         <h5 class="articleSubheadline">July 2014</h5>

            <li>The advantage line now uses the wind at the position in the middle of the leg that the competitor
               to which the line is attached is currently sailing in. Before, the "global" wind average was used which
               is still displayed in the top left corner of the map. You can understand the details by turning on the
               "Streamlet" wind visualization in the Map Settings.</li>
            <li>Faster wind streamlet loading: when you activate the streamlets for wind visualization, they now
               display much faster.</li>
            <li>Faster boat position display: We found that what you're probably the most interested in when you
               first open a race map or move the time slider to some very different point in time is the position of the
               boats at that point in time; and you want to know it fast. The tails which show how the boats got there
               are also interesting, but you won't blame us as much if it takes a little bit to update them. So we've
               separated the placement of the boats from the drawing of their tails. Now you may blame us for the tails
               temporarily not being attached to the boats anymore ;-).</li>

         <ul class="bulletList">
            <li>In the "Maps" settings in the RaceBoard page there is a new checkbox named "Show wind streamlets
               overlay." If you select it and wait for about a minute, a complete wind field will be calculated and
               visualized as an overlay on top of the race course display. It reacts to you moving the time slider and
               shows how the wind differs at different locations on the course. Stronger and faster-moving streamlets
               mean stronger breeze.</li>
            <li>Wind is now calculated location-based. At locations closer to a sensor, that sensor has a higher
               influence on the local wind field than sensors further away. The wind estimations based on the courses
               sailed are assigned a location that corresponds with the "center of gravity" of the field that was used
               for the estimation. For example, if the fleet is approaching the windward mark and the wind sensor in on
               the committee boat on the leeward side of the course, the course-based estimation influences the assumed
               wind field more on the windward side whereas the sensor counts more for the leeward side.</li>
            <li>Switched to the latest version of the Highcharts charting framework. This leads to improvements
               especially on mobile devices. Charts can be zoomed using pinch gestures now.</li>
            <li>To support the use of the SAP Sailing Analytics also for live video streaming formats, we
               introduced a new URL parameter <tt>viewShowMapControls</tt> for the <tt>Spectator.html</tt> and the <tt>RaceBoard.html</tt>
               pages. Setting this parameter to "false" will suppress the zoom, pan and map type selection controls on
               the map display. Example: <a
               href="http://danishleague2014.sapsailing.com/gwt/Spectator.html?leaderboardGroupName=Danish%20League%202014&showRaceDetails=true&viewShowMapControls=false">http://danishleague2014.sapsailing.com/gwt/Spectator.html?leaderboardGroupName=Danish%20League%202014&showRaceDetails=true&viewShowMapControls=false</a>.
               When used for the <tt>Spectator.html</tt> URL, this will apply to all <tt>RaceBoard.html</tt> pages (all
               races) reached from there. Of course, the map can still be panned and zoomed using the usual mouse
               gestures. A left double click zooms in, a right double click zooms out. Zoom can also be controlled using
               the mouse wheel. And panning works by clicking on the map and dragging the mouse. Without the map type
               control, switching to satellite view is not possible (keep this in mind when tracking races in China, see
               below for Google's random coordinate transformations there).

         <h5 class="articleSubheadline">May 2014</h5>

         <ul class="bulletList">
            <li>Fixed an issue with the wind speed charts. Charts that only had a single, unchanged wind speed
               crashed the browser. The solution scales the right hand side Y-axis denoting the wind speed such that it
               always starts at 0kts.</li>
            <li>Analysis of tacks and jibes around mark passings has now been improved. Before, a jibe followed by
               a tack that turns in the same direction (e.g., to port) so far was always called a penalty maneuver. Now,
               if a mark passing separates such a tack from such a jibe, no penalty is called anymore, and the two
               maneuvers are identified correctly.</li>
            <li>Another note on maneuver analysis: we received questions regarding the maneuvers involved in
               clearing an OCS. The SAP Sailing Analytics treat a clearing of an OCS, going back behind the start line
               and crossing it again, as if the competitor started again. In particular this means that all maneuvers
               prior to this new start do not count for the metrics; neither does the distance sailed between the first
               (OCS) start and the clear start.</li>
            <li>A hint regarding the "distance to start line" metrics: please keep in mind that currently this
               measurement is calculated as the distance of the GPS tracker from the line. Unless the tracker is mounted
               near the bow (or at the bow sprit, if any), the distance calculated this way will be greater than what
               counts for crossing the line. Ordering, comparing and aggregating over this figure still makes sense as
               long as you remember this detail.</li>
            <li>Introduced a new leaderboard entry "XTE +/-" featuring a signed cross-track error which shows for a
               leg and also aggregated for an entire race on which side of the leg a competitor stayed on average.
               Currently, the "side" is defined as viewing in the leg's direction, so "left" for a downwind leg is the
               same side as "right" for the corresponding upwind leg.</li>
         </ul>

         <h5 class="articleSubheadline">April 2014</h5>

         <ul class="bulletList">
            <li>China races, such as in Qingdao, may have the map background displayed at slightly wrong locations.
               This is due to an intentional random transformation that Google applies to GPS locations for China. You
               can circumvent this issue by switching to satellite view where the map background is displayed correctly.
               <img src="/images/mapsatellite.png" />
            </li>
            <li>Fixed a bug that in some cases has caused the wind chart, the advantage line, the wind indicator on
               the map and the leaderboard to use slightly different wind values. The problem was related to different
               averaging and damping methods used for these values which has now been aligned.</li>
            <li>Fixed a bug that caused the time spent in a leg, race or regatta to always show the time at the end
               of the leg if the leg has been started by the competitor at the time point queried, e.g., by the time
               slider. While this did not have any serious effects in live mode, for replay races this left the leg time
               and race time constant at the total time spent so far up to the end of the last leg the competitor had
               started at that time.</li>
         </ul>

         <h5 class="articleSubheadline">March 2014</h5>

         <ul class="bulletList">
            <li>Added a new setting for a leaderboard called "Show added scores". Using this feature one can
               display added scores for each leaderboard entry. An added score is the sum over all scores from the first
               column to the current column. One can describe it as an intermediate overall score. This feature can be
               used to know the score until a specific race while another race is live and constantly changes the
               overall score.</li>

            <li>Added tooltips for leaderboard settings.</li>

            <li>Fixed HighPointOverall scheme to also break a tie by looking at the ranks of the last regatta.</li>

            <li>Progress indicator when expanding a race in the RaceBoard view</li>

            <li>Leaderboard column "GPS Lag" shows how far a competitor's GPS signal lags behind the average
               tracking quality. A background color bar classifies into good/ok/bad (green/yellow/red).</li>
         </ul>

         <h5 class="articleSubheadline">February 2014</h5>

         <ul class="bulletList">
            <li>Fixed an issue with boat rotation on Safari browsers</li>

            <li>Maneuver analysis now counts tacks and jibes based on wind at boat position and not based on leg
               type; subsequently, penalty circle analysis is now based on a tack and a jibe in close succession instead
               of a full circle.</li>

            <li>Regatta rank and overall rank in competitor chart of leaderboard panel has been fixed; it did
               erroneously display the rank of the particular race, not the regatta/overall rank after that race.</li>

            <li>Regatta overview now also displays all regatta leaderboards</li>

            <li>Boat colors match tail colors</li>

            <li>When selecting boats in leaderboard, de-selected boats' tails turn grey</li>

         <h5 class="articleSubheadline">January 2014</h5>

         <ul class="bulletList">
            <li>Boat movement animated smoothly</li>

            <li>Start and Finish line show line parameters (length, angle to wind, advantage) when mouse hovers
               over them</li>

            <li>Start line has a count-down indicator displayed next to it before the start. The count-down is also
               displayed underneath the time slider</li>

            <li>Competitor and Wind charts show pre-start data where possible</li>

            <li>Competitors can be assigned a fixed color which they will keep for all races in a regatta</li>

            <li>By default, videos are now shown in a moveable, resizable box embedded in the web page. For a two
               screen setup, the embedded box can be popped out to a dedicated browser window.</li>

            <li>Official score corrections for historic races are only applied after the respective competitor
               finished the race. Therefore, in-between race scores now correspond with tracking, regardless of final
               corrected score.</li>

            <li>By using negative playback speed (e.g., -1), replays can be run backwards.</li>
