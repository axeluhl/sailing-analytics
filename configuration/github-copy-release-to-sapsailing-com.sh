# Download release tar ball and release-notes.txt into the current working directory

# for the prefix specified, nothing it sent to the standard output. The exit status will
# always be 0.
#
# Usage:
#   ./github-copy-release-to-sapsailing-com.sh {BEARER_TOKEN} {release-name-prefix}
# For example:
#  ./github-copy-release-to-sapsailing-com.sh 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 main-
#
# which will download the latest build of the main branch (main-xxxxxxxxxxx) and upload
# it to releases.sapsailing.com.
# Note the "-" at the end of the "main-" prefix specifier; this way we're making name
# clashes with releases whose name happens to start with "main" unlikely. This
# also suggests you shouldn't name releases "main-abcde-xxxxxxxxxxxx" because they would
# produce false matches for the "main-" prefix.
