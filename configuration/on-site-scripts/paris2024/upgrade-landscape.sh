# Upgrades the entire landscape of servers to a new release ${RELEASE}
# The procedure works in the following steps:
#  - patch *.conf files in sap-p1-1:servers/[master|security_service] and sap-p1-2:servers/[secondary_master|replica|master|security_service] so
#    their INSTALL_FROM_RELEASE points to the new ${RELEASE}
#  - Install new releases to sap-p1-1:servers/[master|security_service] and sap-p1-2:servers/[secondary_master|replica|master|security_service]
#  - Update all launch configurations and auto-scaling groups in the cloud (update-launch-configuration.sh)
#  - Tell all replicas in the cloud to stop replicating (stop-all-cloud-replicas.sh)
#  - Tell sap-p1-2 secondary_master to restart (./stop; ./start)
#  - on sap-p1-1:servers/master run ./stop; ./start to bring the master to the new release
#  - wait until master is healthy
#  - launch upgraded cloud replicas and replace old replicas in target group (launch-replicas-in-all-regions.sh)
#  - terminate all instances named "SL paris2024 (Auto-Replica)"; this should cause the auto-scaling group to launch new instances as required
#  - manually inspect the health of everything and terminate the "SL Paris2024 (Upgrade Replica)" instances when enough new instances
#    named "SL paris2024 (Auto-Replica)" are available
