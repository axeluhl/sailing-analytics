Deploy the .mount and .service units to /etc/systemd/system.
Deploy the ephemeralvolume and the patch-mongo-replicaset-name-from-ec2-metadata script to /usr/local/bin
Deploy mongod.conf to /etc

Run with optional EC2 user detail, e.g., as follows:

  REPLICA_SET_NAME=archive
  REPLICA_SET_PRIMARY=dbserver.internal.sapsailing.com:10201

This will automatically patch /etc/mongod.conf such that the replSetName property
is set to the value of REPLICA_SET_NAME. Then, the instance will be added to
the REPLICA_SET_PRIMARY's replica set.
