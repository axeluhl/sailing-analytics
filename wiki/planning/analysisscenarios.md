# Analysis Scenarios

We find that users would like certain analysis scenarios be supported in easier ways than they currently are. For example, one scenario could be "start analysis" and another one "maneuver analysis" whereas a third one could be "wind analysis." Special UI shortcuts and pre-configured perspectives shall support the user in these typical activities.

More advanced users also like to perform historic analyses and would like to see a more systematic approach regarding filtering and aggregation of various metrics accumulated by the core sailing analytics. To what degree should we strengthen an extraction to HANA with Business Objects (BOBJ) tools on top, and to what degree should we aim for an integrated approach where the sailing analytics offer the desired filtering and aggregation features in their Java environment?

We need to understand what the ideal UI approach supporting this would be. Is this a portal with portlets and widgets, or is it a set of preconfigured existing components? We will need UID consultancy for this.

## Candidates for analytical scenarios:
* Start analysis
* Maneuver performance analysis
* Speed analysis
* Track analysis
* Upwind/Downwind performance comparison
* Center of gravity of the competitor field
* Wind change/trend
* Results
* Course and course geometry analysis
* Race simulation (based on Christopher's simulator)
* Sailor profile
* Sailor comparison
