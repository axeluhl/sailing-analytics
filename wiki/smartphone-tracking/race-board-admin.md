# Race Board Admin
[[_TOC_]]

## Purpose
This UI frontend can be used to administer a tracked race. At this point, this means manually setting mark passing times for competitors. It looks similar to the normal race viewer, but requires authentication (like the Admin Console).

## Branch
`race-board-admin`
