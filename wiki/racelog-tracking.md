# RaceLog Tracking
RaceLog-tracking allows fully self-sustained tracking with the Sailing Analytics, with no need for an additional tracking provider. Instead, any source of positional data (e.g. smartphones, providers such as Igtimi without race management) can be integrated.

The term itself should be revised at some point, and currently refers to the technical implementation on how master data related to a race (e.g. competitor registrations, course layout) is recorded and stored persistently: namely in a RaceLog.
