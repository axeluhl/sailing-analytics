#Smartphone Tracking

It is now possible to track races using only smartphones. This can be set up following the following steps.

1. Create Event, Regatta, Leaderboard,... as always. Make sure to make a LeaderboardGroup and attach it to the event.
 
2. Go to the Connectors/RaceLog Tracking tab in the AdminConsole and click the "Denote For RaceLog Tracking" symbol in the Actions bar (Green arrow pointing right). 

3. Register (or create) the competitors for the leaderboard using the symbol also in the Actions bar. It is also possible denote for RaceLog Tracking or register competitors to each race individually, but since                         this is usually the same for an entire event it is easier to do it for the whole leaderboard.

4. Click the "Define Course Layout" symbol (Two flags/marks) on the Actions tab of the first race of the leaderboard. Create a course by defining first marks and then waypoints. Use the copy symbol (Two pieces of paper) to copy the course to other races.
Note: In the future it should be possible to do this for the entire leaderboard too, as the course does not change for many events.

5. If not using the Buoy-Positioning App, it is possible to set the mark locations in the course layout panel, using the "Set Mark Location" symbol on the right of the mark list. If using the Race Committee App, make sure to only use the ByMarks Course Designer, as ByName can overwrite a manually created course with an empty one. 

6a. Map the smartphones to the competitors using the "Map Devices to Competitors and Mark" tab of the Leaderboard Actions bar (or for each race, but going over the leaderboard is usually easier, as above). Select each Competitor and scan the QR-Code with the Tracking-App. Do not forget to press (or remind the sailors to press) start tracking before the races start. Mappings can be viewed (and deleted) in the "Map Devices to Competitors and Marks" window of each race.

6b. Alternatively, go to the Leaderboards/Leaderboard Configuration tab, select your leaderboard and click on the people/competitor action bar button (tooltip is "Edit Competitors"). Make sure that the competitors you want to invite have valid e-mail addresses, select them, then click the "Invite competitors" button at the top of the list. The competitors will receive an e-mail with the QR code and a link that they can use to bind their device.

7. To use the Buoy Positioning App click the "Invite Buoy Tenders" symbol in the Leaderboard Actions tab and send a QR-Code by email to be scanned using the App.
