# User Management and Security

As a feature of the Sports Sponsorships Engine (SSE) which underlies the SAP Sailing Analytics, our Tennis engagements, parts of the Equestrian contributions and in the future perhaps more, we are about to introduce user management to the platform. Based on [Benjamin Ebling's Bachelor thesis](/doc/theses/20140915_Ebling_Authentication_and_Authorization_for_SAP_Sailing_Analytics.pdf) we are introducing [Apache Shiro](http://shiro.apache.org) to the platform. Our Bugzilla has a separate [component for User and Account Management](http://bugzilla.sapsailing.com/bugzilla/buglist.cgi?query_format=advanced&bug_status=NEW&bug_status=ASSIGNED&bug_status=REOPENED&component=User%20and%20Account%20Management&product=Sailing%20Race%20Analytics) that documents the open issues.

## Shiro Integration into SSE

### Bundle Structure

The following bundles implement the Shiro-based security features for SSE:

#### com.sap.sse.security

This bundle contains the core Shiro libraries which so far are not yet part of the target platform. It provides basic services such as the `SecurityService` and utilities such as `SessionUtils` and `ClientUtils`. The `SecurityService` instance is created by the bundle activator and registered with the OSGi service registry.

`UsernamePasswordRealm` and `OAuthRealm` are two realm implementations provided by the bundle that can be used in `shiro.ini` configuration files. Both realms store and obtain user-specific data including the roles and permissions in a `UserStore` (see the [com.sap.sse.security.userstore.mongodb](/wiki/info/landscape/usermanagement#user-management-and-security_shiro-integration-into-sse_bundle-structure_com-sap-sse-security-userstore-mongodb) section) which is an instance shared by the realm objects as well as the `SecurityService`.

A web bundle that wants to use Shiro-based security and user management features should declare the following in its `WEB-INF/web.xml` descriptor:

	<context-param>
		<param-name>shiroEnvironmentClass</param-name>
		<param-value>org.apache.shiro.web.env.IniWebEnvironment</param-value>
	</context-param>
	<listener>
		<listener-class>org.apache.shiro.web.env.EnvironmentLoaderListener</listener-class>
	</listener>
	<filter>
		<filter-name>ShiroFilter</filter-name>
		<filter-class>org.apache.shiro.web.servlet.ShiroFilter</filter-class>
	</filter>
	<!--	Make sure any request you want accessible to Shiro is filtered. "/*" 
		catches all requests. Usually this filter mapping is defined first (before all 
		others) to ensure that Shiro works in subsequent filters in the filter chain: -->
	<filter-mapping>
		<filter-name>ShiroFilter</filter-name>
		<url-pattern>/*</url-pattern>
		<dispatcher>REQUEST</dispatcher>
		<dispatcher>FORWARD</dispatcher>
		<dispatcher>INCLUDE</dispatcher>
		<dispatcher>ERROR</dispatcher>
	</filter-mapping>

It is then the `shiro.ini` configuration file which needs to be in the using bundle's classpath root that configures Shiro to use the elements provided by the `com.sap.sse.security` bundle. A typical `shiro.ini` configuration file using the `com.sap.sse.security` bundle could look like this:
<pre>

[main]
shiro.loginUrl = /security/ui/Login.html
shiro.successUrl = /UserManagement.html
anyofroles = com.sap.sse.security.AnyOfRolesFilter
anyofroles.loginUrl = ../security/ui/Login.html

credentialsMatcher = org.apache.shiro.authc.credential.Sha256CredentialsMatcher
# base64 encoding, not hex in this example:
credentialsMatcher.storedCredentialsHexEncoded = false
credentialsMatcher.hashIterations = 1024

# configure the username/password realm:
upRealm = com.sap.sse.security.UsernamePasswordRealm
upRealm.credentialsMatcher = $credentialsMatcher

# configure the OAuth realm:
oauthRealm = com.sap.sse.security.OAuthRealm

securityManager.realms = $upRealm, $oauthRealm

sessionManager = com.sap.sse.security.SecurityWebSessionManager
securityManager.sessionManager = $sessionManager

authc = com.sap.sse.security.CustomFilter
authc.loginUrl = ../security/ui/Login.html
authc.successUrl  = /security/ui/UserManagement.html

roles.loginUrl = ../security/ui/Login.html

sessionDAO = org.apache.shiro.session.mgt.eis.EnterpriseCacheSessionDAO
securityManager.sessionManager.sessionDAO = $sessionDAO

cacheManager = com.sap.sse.security.SessionCacheManager
securityManager.cacheManager = $cacheManager

[urls]
/security/ui/UserManagement.html = roles[admin]
/YourFantasyURL.html = anyofroles[admin,eventmanager]
</pre>

In addition to URL-based security that is configured in `shiro.ini`, using bundles can do two more things:

* Use `SecurityUtils.getSubject()` in server-side code to obtain the current subject on whose behalf the call is being executed. This allows the application to check for roles and permissions, as in
<pre>
    if (SecurityUtils.getSubject().checkRole("some-role")) {
        ... // do something for which the subject must have role "some-role"
    } else {
        ... // throw some security exception or simply don't carry out the transaction
    }
</pre>

* Use the `SecurityService` API to store and retrieve data such as preferences or settings and work with the user base, including creating, modifying and deleting user accounts and manipulating their roles. The `SecurityService` registers itself with the OSGi registry upon bundle activation. 
<pre>
    ServiceTracker<SecurityService, SecurityService> tracker = new ServiceTracker<>(context, SecurityService.class, /* customizer */ null);
    tracker.open();
    SecurityService securityService = tracker.waitForService(0);
</pre>
The security service offers methods such as `addSetting`, `setSetting` and `getSetting` to manage name/value pairs. The settings API is typed in the sense that when registering a setting 

#### com.sap.sse.security.userstore.mongodb

The `UserStore` interface has an implementation provided by this bundle: `UserStoreImpl`. It uses MongoDB for persistence of all user store entries including the credentials for the `UsernamePasswordRealm` and all global and user-specific settings.

The `UserStoreImpl` is created by the bundle activator and is registered under the `UserStore` interface in the OSGi service registry. The `com.sap.sse.security` bundle activator is implemented such that it waits for a service to appear for the `UserStore` interface in the service registry before it takes this service and passes it to the `SecurityServiceImpl` constructor, resulting in the `SecurityService` instance that is in turn registered with the OSGi service registry.

The standard `MongoDBService` is used to obtain a configuration for the persistence layer. In particular, during test execution, the `winddbTest` DB will be used instead of the default database.

#### com.sap.sse.security.ui

This GWT web bundle provides a number of UI-related components and a number of entry points which implement basic user management and security features. Additionally, a GWT RPC service `UserManagementService` exposing user management services to GWT clients and a class `UserService` helping client-side applications to track, sign in and sign out the current user is provided.

A GWT application that only wants to know what the currently signed-in user is (if any), which roles and permissions that user has and being notified about changes of the currently signed-in user (e.g., if the user signs out or if the set of roles and permissions change) uses the `UserService` class in conjunction with an instance of the `UserManagementServiceAsync` interface. Typical code in an entry point could look like this:
<pre>
        UserManagementServiceAsync userManagementService = GWT.create(UserManagementService.class);
        EntryPointHelper.registerASyncService((ServiceDefTarget) userManagementService,
                RemoteServiceMappingConstants.userManagementServiceRemotePath);
        UserService userService = new UserService(userManagementService);
</pre>

The entry points, as of this writing, offer a simple sign-in form (`Login.html`), a sign-up form (`Register.html`), a form to edit the signed-in user's profile (`EditProfile.html`), an entry point linked to by e-mail bodies used for address validation (`EmailValidation.html`) and a page to be used by administrators to edit user accounts (`UserManagement.html`).

The `LoginPanel` component may be used by applications to display sign-up/sign-in/sign-out features. Its styling is adjustable by a CSS resource which can be passed to the component's constructor, this way adjusting the component's style to that of the application using and embedding it.

We plan to turn the `UserManagementPanel` which is the widget behind the `UserManagementEntryPoint` into a drop-in component for a generalized administration console concept. So, when the AdminConsole becomes an SSE concept then the user management tab can be made available to all applications using the AdminConsole concept. See also bugs [2424](http://bugzilla.sapsailing.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=2424) and [2425](http://bugzilla.sapsailing.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=2425).

## Sample Session

When you try to reach a protected resource without having the necessary permissions, Shiro will redirect you to the sign-in page.

![Sign-in page](/wiki/images/LoginScreen.png)

When a system is still in its initial state, the default credentials are `admin` as the user name and `admin` as the password. When the sign-in was successful, you will be redirected to the protected page you originally wanted to visit (or stay on the sign-in page in case that was the URL you explicitly visited).

To edit your user profile, visit `/security/ui/EditProfile.html`.

![Sign-in page](/wiki/images/EditProfile.png)

It allows the signed-in user to change the e-mail address and reset or update the password. Changing the e-mail address will result in a validation e-mail sent to the new e-mail address provided. Until the user has confirmed the e-mail by clicking on the embedded link, the new e-mail address will be considered not validated.

The password reset feature is only available for users whose e-mail address has successfully been validated. Otherwise, users who do not have the `admin` role need to provide their current password and the new password, including a confirmation of the new password. An e-mail notification will be sent to the user's e-mail address about the password change. Administrators can simply provide the new password and confirm it, leaving the field for the current password empty.

A new user can sign up by visiting the `/security/ui/Register.html` page. 

![Sign-in page](/wiki/images/Register.png)

New users need to provide a unique name. Providing an e-mail address is optional, but if no validated e-mail address exists, certain services will not be made available to that user, in particular the password reset feature.

A mail is sent out to the e-mail address provided, asking the user to confirm the e-mail address by clicking on a link embedded in the e-mail. Complying to do so will mark the e-mail address as validated, and features requiring a validated e-mail address will be made available to the user from then on.

Administrators (users with role `admin`) can use the `/security/ui/UserManagement.html` entry point (future versions will probably integrate this into the AdminConsole framework as a standard tab).

![Sign-in page](/wiki/images/UserManagement1.png)

The user management page offers administrators to create and delete users, search for users and change their settings. Creating a new user works pretty much as in the `/security/ui/Register.html` entry point:

![Sign-in page](/wiki/images/CreateUser.png)

To delete a user, find it in the list on the left side of the page, using the filter text box above the list and the paging buttons. 

![Sign-in page](/wiki/images/UserManagement2.png)

The right-hand side of the view shows the user details and allows administrators to edit them, very similar to the `/security/ui/EditProfile.html` page. At the bottom of this view, there is a field to manage the roles assigned to the user selected. To add a role, enter the role name into the text field and press the `Add` button.

![Sign-in page](/wiki/images/AddRole.png)

Roles currently assigned to the user can be removed by pressing the red `X` button next to the role name:

![Sign-in page](/wiki/images/RemovingRoles.png)

These changes take effect immediately if the user that is being edited is the user currently signed in. Note that in particular if you are signed in with the `admin` role and remove this role for yourself, you will not be able to edit your roles any further but will need to ask another administrator to do so.

## RESTful API

There is a RESTful web service reachable at the URL `/security/api/restsecurity`:

* `/security/api/restsecurity/login`, type POST, parameters are `username` and `password`. Use, e.g., with `curl` from the command line as in `curl -D /tmp/header -d "username=admin&password=admin" http://myserver.sapsailing.com/security/api/restsecurity/login` and find the cookie identifying the session in file `/tmp/header` which should contain a line of the form<pre>
Set-Cookie: JSESSIONID=f563a4fc-2333-45c4-8f82-3069f502680d; Path=/; HttpOnly
</pre>
* `/security/api/restsecurity/logout`, type GET, which terminates the current session when provided with the right cookie. Example: `curl --cookie JSESSIONID=f563a4fc-2333-45c4-8f82-3069f502680d http://myserver.sapsailing.com/security/api/restsecurity/logout`
